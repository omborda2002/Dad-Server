Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.\"Rating: A.",

This sparks a dangerous, world-spanning journey. Based on the book series by Robert Jordan.The acting is actually very good but they can only do so much when the writing is aweful.Some of the story changes are understandable, but most times the changes are nearly incomprehensible dont seem to serve a purpose. Additionally, there are a couple of moments that the writers make very poor story choices resulting in at least one instance of using the sin of \"Deus Ex Machina\" to escape their own story traps. This is lazy writing at its worst.There are also fundamental changes to the main and side characters along with fundamental changes in relationships between people and organizations. This is another major writing sin and seriously jeopardizes eliminating or watering down both major and minor themes of the original story. Inexcusable.There are other issues with poor site locations. A good example of this is picking a river next to a cliff to represent a part of a river delta for the largest river in the world. REALLY?I gutted this season out and watched every episode from beginning to end so I could give the show an honest shot and not be one of tgose people that posts an opinion based on ignorance.Season 1 did have a few moments that were at least decent, but not enough to make up for the rest of its considerable flaws and sins, therefore, I will NOT be watching season 2.",

The problem - its on a direct collision course with Earth. The other problem? No one really seems to care. Turns out warning mankind about a planet-killer the size of Mount Everest is an inconvenient fact to navigate. With the help of Dr. Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan), Kate and Randall embark on a media tour that takes them from the office of an indifferent President Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her sycophantic son and Chief of Staff, Jason (Jonah Hill), to the airwaves of The Daily Rip, an upbeat morning show hosted by Brie (Cate Blanchett) and Jack (Tyler Perry). With only six months until the comet makes impact, managing the 24-hour news cycle and gaining the attention of the social media obsessed public before its too late proves shockingly comical - what will it take to get the world to just look up?. ‚ÄîNetflixTwo astronomers discover a massive comet heading towards Earth. The comet will wipe out mankind in six months time if nothing is done about it. They manage to gain an audience with the US President, land on TV talk shows and have their story printed in the media but everyone seems to have other priorities.On the surface a disaster movie in the vein of Armageddon or Deep Impact. However, it is not just that and is far better than that.Written and directed by Adam McKay (The Big Short, Vice, The Other Guys, Anchorman), Dont Look Up is a funny, accurate examination of the warped priorities and agendas of the people who have the largest control over our lives. Politicians care more about how something will impact their polling numbers than saving mankind, the media cares more about finding something slanderous on a person than alerting people to imminent destruction, talk shows care more about sensationalism, the personal lives of vapid pop stars and on putting on a happy face than on news that actually matters to people, corporate opportunists who use even a planet-destroying disaster to make a profit and in so doing increase the danger (and how the politicians fall in line behind them).It is all quite chillingly accurate and plausible: from experience you can relate to the misguided, self-absorbed agendas of these institutions and individuals and the powerlessness and irritation you feel in having to deal with them and their decisions.It is so close to home that it sometimes makes the film irritating to watch: youd rather not be reminded how incompetent, superficial, self-servicing and nefarious the government, media etc are, how they screw up your life on a regular basis and how likely it is that they will eventually wipe out mankind.All this makes for a film that is one part hilariously funny and another part scarily serious and confronting. Unlike some other movies I did not find this mix of comedy and drama jarring. In fact, the humour helps point out the absurdity of it all.By the way, keep watching until the very end. Theres two scenes woven into/after the credits that are worth sticking around for.",

    "story": "Manu, a bodybuilder from Chandigarh falls in love with Maanvi, a Zumba teacher. All seems well until a shocking revelation causes turmoil in their love story.Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui (2021) :\nMovie Review -Ayushmann Khurrana is on a dream run. The kind of cinema he is making consistently, puts him in a different league of his own- far away from his contemporaries. Looking at his recent films, nobody can deny that, rather we are getting used to it. Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui is yet another \"Taboo-Breaking Entertainer\" in Ayushmann Khurrana Club, a single member club which is established by him, run by him and is being ruled by him and him only. While others are busy making mainstream cinema even more typical, this guy is busy in reforging mainstream cinema by mixing commercial elements with taboo but socially important subjects. Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui is his Trademark Entertainer! But wait, we have a big surprise, The Vaani Kapoor. Abhishek Kapoor dares to make a love-story which hasnt been made in Bollywood yet and his attempt is definitely watchable, with those expected flaws.The film is about Manu (Ayushmann Khurrana), a gym owner and a bodybuilder who falls in love with Zumba teacher Maanvi, played by Vaani Kapoor. Everything goes smoothy until one sudden moment when he learns the truth about Maanvis past which shatters him mentally and physically. The surprise must be enjoyed without any spoilers so lets not reveal anything here. The screenplay is quite engaging and pacy with the entire first half unfolding lots of things within an hour. That leaves second half with no surprises and predictable happy ending but its pretty a speech-maker and learning experience. The film deals with the topic which may not be accepted today, especially by the family audience but surely after 40-50 years, it will get that deserving appreciation. If the second half had something more to show, this would have been a fantastic affair afterall.Ayushmann Khurrana is fantastic as Manu. The film shows him in a macho avatar, something he hasnt done before. The female fans are gonna scream out for him. But lets not forget the main reason behind it. He plays that egoistic macho who learns the actual meaning of being a \"MARD\". Thats where he wins the battle by losing one. His companion, Vaani Kapoor is a complete surprise package. You might just think it for a moment that this role was meant to be played by her only. No other actress could have done it better and the way she fearlessly delivers those dialogues will force you think about that never-ending pain, problems and struggle. The supporting cast gets a lot of laughter, to be frank, much more than the leading pair.Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui has got a very good music album which is filled with local flavours and romance. That foot-tapping title song appears with the end credits, unfortunately. Kheench Te Nach and Tumbe Pe Zumba are pretty nice situational grooving numbers whereas Kalle Kalle is practically very effective song. The film has got good dialogues too. Some are typical one-liners while some are intelligently hard-hitting, which might leave family audiences feel uncomfortable. Director Abhishek Kapoor tries his hands in some kind of new genre with the brand ambassador of the club Ayushmann and he successfully manages to present the taboo context without any compromises. The film falls flat at some occasions where it couldnt battle out the predictability and few of those typical hindi cinema cliches. But the fact that you cant really go too intellectual while making a commercial cinema saves a lot of bashing. You need to to little bashing where its due. For instance, the family affair, completely unnecessary and over-dramatic. That sister eavesdropping with Stethoscope, seriously? How dumb it looked. Nevertheless, its a nice attempt by Abhishek Kapoor which will help him to change his image too. He brings us the most surprising love-story of recent times and a new form of progressive cinema. Ayushmann Khurrana and Vaani Kapoors \"Taboo-Breaking Aashiqui\" is unmissable for content cinema lovers who have that hunger of watching something new, something really interesting. However, it also tries to be formal audience at the same time, so you might hate that part so prepare yourself for that. Rest, its enjoyable. Far better than recent So Called good films (after re-opening), content-wise i mean.RATING - 6/10*",

Siddhant & Sharvari certainly lack experience to meet our expectations. At least Varun Sharma tried to revive these iconic characters into such unconvincing con-job.",

As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planets exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence-a commodity capable of unlocking humanitys greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will survive. ‚ÄîWarner Bros.Its definitely a well-directed film. The music is beautiful and the desert views intended to show us the planet Arrakis are impressive. But unfortunately, there is practically nothing behind the beautiful exterior. Even if Villeneuve filmed only half of the first book, this half was supposed to introduce us to the universe and many main and secondary characters. Unfortunately, the duration of 2.5 hours for the director was only enough to briefly introduce the main characters and slightly describe the situation in the galaxy. Too little time has been given to supporting characters. Some are presented, but not disclosed. Especially disappointed by Liet-Kains, his line was cut to almost zero.Bottom line.The universe of Dune is very extensive and it is extremely difficult to film even one book in less than 3-4 films with a similar timing.It would be better if they made a series. With a budget like Game of Thrones. They would most likely be successful .A film can only be watched for the sake of a beautiful picture and wonderful music.5/10.Sorry for the mistakes.

They face trouble from local politicians and from the people of the village who constantly criticize the teams poor efforts in capturing the tiger.Sherni is not everyones cup of tea. Knowing that it is directed by \"Newton\" director Amit Masurkar , you should not expect it to be a spine chilling animal hunt. However, this film aims at promoting animal conservation rather than killing them. There are so many who get affected by tigers and want them to be dead, but should they really be killed? That one emotional scene from the climax will prove it that tigers too have a life. You may not be able to train tigers to respect humans by not killing but that doesnt mean we dont respect them, that would leave no difference between us and the tigers.The film does have some interesting points especially when Vidya and her team are out for capturing the tiger, rest every part relies on conversations and tribal rage.The tribal cast like Sampa Mandal deserve special applause especially for their stellar natural performance. Their performances make sure you get the feeling of being in a forest tribal region. Vidya Balan roars! She doesnt shout too much but her dialogues do the roaring. Vijay Raaz, Sharat Saxena (hes the one that the film aims to be against), Neeraj Kabi etc all have done a good job as well.Negatives - Mukul Chadda is wasted here and his parts could have been avoided. Some scenes of politics could have been avoided.Overall, a must watch film for those interested in knowing what happens in the jungles and the tribal people and since it has a message, you definitely should watch it.",

Jacqueline Fernandes is simply here because of Salman Khans benevolence, and Yami tries to push some life into an otherwise forgettable performance.Saif Ali Khan is the only actor trying to do some justice to his character. Dont go in expecting a good movie, but if you are a fan of the original \"supernatural\", youre bound to like this goofy attempt to copy it.Movie has a lot of plot holes, but enough entertainment value to look over it.Just watch this for mindless entertainment mixed with usual bollywood tropes and keep your reasoning skills aside when you do it, Im sure youll end up enjoying this.",

Dreaming about saving countless lives and having another adventure, the feisty English feminist and doctor of botany, Dr Lily Houghton, embarks on a peril-laden mission to change the world. Along with her fashionable brother, MacGregor, Dr Houghton enlists the help of the arrogant, wisecracking riverboat skipper, Captain Frank Wolff, to guide them through the serpentine Amazon River in La Quila, his swift wooden boat. Now, as the intrepid trio ventures deeper and deeper into the heart of an impenetrable green maze, searching for something that cannot be found, a centuries-old curse and the ruthless aristocrat, Prince Joachim, threaten to put an end to their ambitious plans. And, sooner or later, the jungle always wins. Is it true that the Spanish conquistador, Don Aguirre, was lost in the same God-forsaken part of the world? ‚ÄîNick RiganasJungle Cruise is the latest Disney live-action film. The director is Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed many entertaining Liam Neeson action flicks. Glad to say, the direction is gorgeous here.Despite being type-casted, Dwayne Johnson gives a very likable and charming performance. His character and Emily Blunts scientist character is the best aspect of Jungle Cruise. Their chemistry is very enjoyable.Now there are some dumb Disney jokes, obviously for younger audience to have fun. The jokes are mostly presented by the comic relief character, McGregor.The three main cast work well, but unfortunately not the villains. There are 2 groups of villains, one is the Germans, the other one is some supernatural trope of people. Why cant there just be one?The film asks you to believe a lot of things. Theres a certain thing explored about a character in the 2nd act that just didnt work for me. Youll know what Im talking about when you see it.The movie at times feel like a Disney ride, which is its source material. Jungle Cruise is perfect for people who want a CGI-filled fun ride.",

This sequel is a loud and frantic mess, where superpowers can do whatever the plot demands, characters dont care about consistency, and the same jokes are repeated a dozen times.

    "story": "Former wrestler Ricky and his wife Julia make a living performing with their children Saraya and Zak. When brother and sister get the chance to audition for WWE, they learn that becoming a WWE Superstar demands more than they ever imagined possible.Full disclosure first, I am a wrestling fan and I knew the majority of Paiges story and how the WWE and pro-wrestling works before seeing this.The Knight family love professional wrestling. It has changed the lives of Julia (Lena Headey) and Ricky (Nick Frost) and their passion has transferred to their three children, particularly to their son Zak (Jack Lowden) and daughter Saraya (Florence Pugh). Having grown up performing for the families Norwich based federation, a shot at the big time comes when both children are asked to attend try-outs for World Wrestling Entertainment.All that said, you dont really need to know anything about wrestling to enjoy \"Fighting with My Family\". Its a relatable story of someone from an unlikely background overcoming the odds to find success far from home. Its has a very British sense of humour, with lots of jokes with swearwords or about class differences, both between the Knights and Zaks prospective in-laws and between Paige and her peers once shes over in the performance centre. It probably has slightly too much swearing to be a real family film, but is still pretty gentle in its overall tone and themes. What makes the film successful is the performances of actors in the key roles. Frost and Headey are great, as is Florence Pugh, who continues to be a star on the rise after her performance in \"Little Drummer Girl\" last year. Its Jack Lowden, however, who has the most to do and excels with it, dealing with the disappointments and temptations that his life gives him as a parallel to his sisters.That perhaps leads to me the films biggest weakness, despite how unlikely it seems, Paiges journey isnt perhaps that extraordinary. Shes way more talented and experienced than any of her colleagues but struggles a bit to overcome her own awkwardness. Its not so much an emotional rollercoaster as it is a jittering ski lift. To combat that, we get the opposing journey of Zak which, if anything, is actually more interesting, as he struggles with fatherhood, disillusionment and jealously before coming to terms and reconciling with his family.\"Fighting with My Family\" is an entertaining and funny film if a little slight and though I cant imagine its going to be anybodys favourite film of all time, its a lot of fun to watch and Im sure would be enjoyed by anyone.A little bonus if you are a fan of the UK wrestling scene from the past few years is spotting cameos from current stars. Dave Mastiff and Kip Sabian are two of the most obvious but theres a few more (and a dig a Pete Dunne which is funny, if slightly confusing).",

Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones are terrific in their roles and the action sequences are pulse-pounding.

His acting in the flashback portion is very natural and he deserves an applause for accepting that character.AR Rahmans BGM and Nirav Shahs camera work lift the movie to another level.Negative:\nAn underwhelming and weak storyline that is easily predictable. Screenplay is flat, without any interesting cat-and-mouse moments between the protagonist and antagonist.Given that most of the superhero films in the Hollywood too have such simple and predictable storylines, the only negative of the film can be magnanimously ignored.Go watch this indigenous product, that will definitely make you proud as an Indian!",

You would think the producers would have hired better writers instead of pathetically paying for almost every review on here 9 and above being fake (pretty much only film reviewed). I may have given this film a 7 or 8 out of 10, but only gets a 6 for the fake reviews. For me it could have been much better and deserving of the 9s and 10s had the writing been tighter.

The other actors shine as well, Ronnies two friends play their parts to the T, Venus singh as Avantika is very relate able and she brings in an innocence and lightness to the show as well. Ronnies dad is every dad I know, especially my own. The small nuances in dialogue and setup is truly commendable. Overall the plots are really interesting and keep you on your toes, you want ronnie to win, to sort the problems out and to come out on top.The cinematography is simple, without ever intruding into the characters spaces, you feel like youre looking into someones life. The music is very catchy, Overall super potential here to make something very enjoyable that a whole family can watch inspite of all the cuss words. Indian Television content today is in such a horrible state that definitely they can take a leaf or two from this book and learn. Great job to the whole team, casting directors, production crew and editors, Looking forward to season 2 and many more.",

    "story": "In the early 1990s, Jordan Belfort teamed with his partner Donny Azoff and started brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont. Their company quickly grows from a staff of 20 to a staff of more than 250 and their status in the trading community and Wall Street grows exponentially. So much that companies file their initial public offerings through them. As their status grows, so do the amount of substances they abuse, and so do their lies. They draw attention like no other, throwing lavish parties for their staff when they hit the jackpot on high trades. That ultimately leads to Belfort featured on the cover of Forbes Magazine, being called \"The Wolf Of Wall St.\". With the FBI onto Belforts trading schemes, he devises new ways to cover his tracks and watch his fortune grow. Belfort ultimately comes up with a scheme to stash their cash in a European bank. But with the FBI watching him like a hawk, how long will Belfort and Azoff be able to maintain their elaborate wealth and luxurious lifestyles? ‚Äîhalo1kBrilliantly acted, superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese, it is a masterclass of directorial craft.Showy when it needs to be, but also quiet and contemplative. \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is the equivalent of something like \"Good Fellas\" or even more so \"Casino\" but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stones \"Wall Street\".Where Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.Leonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.Its a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.One could almost hear Scorseses clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.It is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference. For every individual but also society as a whole.",

    "story": "The true story of Londons most notorious gangsters, twins Reggie and Ronnie Kray. As the brothers rise through the criminal underworld, Ronnie advances the family business with violence and intimidation while Reggie struggles to go legitimate for local girl Frances Shea. In and out of prison, Ronnies unpredictable tendencies and the slow disintegration of Reggies marriage threaten to bring the brothers empire tumbling to the ground.It is true that glasses and change of hairdo can actually produce a different personality. This movie is mostly dedicated to Tom Hardy delivering his excellent, albeit slightly and funnily schizophrenic, acting prowess. As far as biopic goes, other films such as Black Mass delivers a more in depth-look of the mafia life style, but Legend opts for a direct personal view of the brothers and takes full advantage of the lead actor.Tom Hardy plays as both Ron and Reggie Kray, performed with a tweak of facial expression and mild change on make-up. Reggie is the more levelheaded one while Ron can be described as batcrap insane. They are both capable of violence and living a shared gangster life. The events are told by narration from Frances (Emily Browning), Reggies love interest and a silent witness to the horrible dealings.The movies strongest point is undoubtedly the lead, it is not often that this \"one actor two roles\" is used in cinema recently. Tom Hardy delivers everything expected from him, from the subtle or strong expression, change of speech and mannerism to intricate body language of different characters. Viewers know the twin scene is done by effect, yet they often look like two different persons interacting with each other.It dabbles in less criminal activities and more in private life, evident by using Frances a key point for developments even though she is mostly there as spectator, especially when mafia dealings are concerned. Emily Browning is a good addition, she handles her own well, but its not the level of outlandish on-screen presence like the Krays.While there is a definite involvement of crime thriller aspect, it doesnt portray the shady indulgent in its entirety. Its not the intricate inside view like that of American Hustle. There are few violent scenes, although the movie is not a noir gritty musing and some of the events could be done more thoroughly.Tom Hardy has done some interesting roles, but none arguably had this level of complexity. Legend further cemented his acting signature on the silver screen, it may not be an in-depth take of criminal enterprise, but he alone, or two of him, is enough to carry the movie.",

With the help from his stepfather Hank (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) he decodes the message leading him to find the map that leads him to Vernes mysterious island. Along with Gabato and Kailani, Sean embarks on a mission to find his grandfather, the legendary Vernian Alexander. But unexpected problems arise as Alexander made a mistake that could change everything. ‚ÄîAnonymous User - EarthThe 17-year-old Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) receives a coded signal and his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) helps him to decipher the message. They find that Seans grandfather Alexander Anderson (Michael Caine) has found the mysterious island in the Pacific described by Julio Verne and two other writers in their novels.The stubborn Sean wants to travel to the coordinates and Hank decides to buy the tickets and travel with the teenager to a small island nearby the location. They rent an old helicopter owned by the locals Gabato (Luis Guzm√°n) and his teenage daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) and the group heads to the unknown spot. Along their journey, they cross a hurricane and crash in the island. They find a beautiful and dangerous place, surrounded by forests, volcanoes with lava of gold and menacing life forms. The meet also the old Alexander and Hank discovers that the island is sinking. Now their only chance to survive is to find the legendary Nautilus. \"Journey 2: The Mysterious Island\" is a movie with a trailer that is better than the film itself. The lame screenplay begins in a fast pace, with Hank and Sean guessing to quickly the message. The story is very weak and the film is supported by the special effects only. The spoiled Sean and the rude Alexander are detestable characters and Gabato is stupid and annoying and never funny as supposed to be. Hank is multi- skilled in codes, hydraulic and electric engineering, medicine, and music and diving. In the end, \"Journey 2: The Mysterious Island\" is a very disappointing adventure. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): \"Viagem 2: A Ilha Misteriosa\" (\"Journey 2: The Mysterious Island\")",

It was entertaining. The story worked well. The acting was great. And the effects were really impressive. I watched it on a big screen in Bangkok and enjoyed the experience. The sound was equally impressive. I just cant understand why the really negative reviews abound. Some are cursing it for having foreign actors. Others about the political situation etc. And the poor director is even getting a caning. The story is about a legend. And it was wonderful to just sit back and let someone tell a story. I nearly didnt go because of all the bad reviews but I am glad I went and made up my own mind.Go and see it.",

My boys said it was excellent.The plot was simple enough, bad guy wants revenge for the murder of a loved one. In all honesty, it didnt seem to need a wide range of acting from Dwayne Johnson (aka, The Rock). I should rephrase that; it wasnt so much the dialog, but his mannerisms and facial expressions that said it all!The movie wasnt just about revenge, it also looked into how he got to be the way he was... the way he was treated growing up. It talked about forgiveness & redemption. I say its about time The Rock (I will always know him as that!) got back to what he does best, Action/Adventure. Like The Rundown he did with Sean Scott. All in All, I would give this movie a B++",

If you liked that one you will like this. It is very much just more of the same. If it aint broke, you know.A couple new faces, one of them I really liked seeing. Wont say who it was, but if youre older than 20, chances are good you like the person.The action is like last time, its entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good. The Rock has some, lets call them punching scenes, which I liked. Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.They once again have fun with the fact that the characters \"in game\" represent characters in the movies \"real life\". And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think hes taking some serious acting classes, hes getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.I didnt feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though. Felt more like just an adventure, than an adventure videogame. They could have hammered home a little better.\nSo yeah, I was entertained, but its pretty shallow and wont stick with me like, say, the origianl Jumanji. (I watched that as a kid, and it was kind of revolutionary, so of course it stuck) Nice family flick.",

The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and its a shocker....but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. Until then, Smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. You know he has a good reason for doing it, but its never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end.All of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins (\"Emily Posa\") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....but dont because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together.This is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho Will Smith film. In fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of Smith throughout this story. It almost doesnt even look like him in a number of shots. He looks like hes lost weight and is sick. Smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness.Like a good movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits.",

The BGM was quite loud whereas most songs in the movie failed to impress.The climax was too predictable after the first half.The direction was pretty ordinary ,mixing up comedy and serious scenes.The story sometimes went out of logic but the stunts were really awesome and pulsating.The stunts were of high class even though it was a little exaggerated. Overall the movie is a good entertainer for the its stunts and comedies but only a one time watch for the story.",

On that trip, Savitri meets Rishi (Nara Rohit), who falls in love with her instantly, shaking up both of their marriage plans.This cute Telagu romance is laugh-out-loud funny in places, reminding me of a 1940s Hollywood screwball comedy. Unfortunately, as a lot of the humor was spoken in quick deliveries, it was hard to keep up while reading subtitles. In addition, there was a subplot that didnt make complete sense, nor particularly add to the plot. Rohit was excellent, easily pulling the audience to his side, and his action scenes were great fun. Nandithas part was such that the viewer has to warm to her, and she played it well. The pair had good chemistry together. Overall, though silly in parts, it was an enjoyable film.",

The execution of there movies is fantastic they always try new genre and they are fantastic in creating suspence in there films.And this movie Thadam is an example of that. God damn !! What a beautiful movie Director Magizh Thirumeni has made. I even salute the screen play and story writers. And the actors have earned my applause too.This film is one of the best Crime/Thrillers I have watched in a recent times. There was an another Tamil movie called Ratchasan which had blown out my mind. And now this one does the same.Hats off Tamil Cinema you are the best !!My review 10/10.",

He blends history, reality, fiction with a good dose of adventure and thrill which engages the viewer. Also, he imparts an ancient-medieval look to the film in the parts where it is necessary be it through sepia-tint, patina, cobwebs, etc which lends a certain authenticity.However, in Pakistan, he has the locals talking in Telugu which seemed out of place and inaccurate.Yeleti has been able to get the best out of his technicians be it his writing team, cinematographer Shamdat, editor Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao, music director Sri or art director Ramakrishna. Shamdats camera is top-notch.He shoots the action sequences and the treasure hunt, especially towards the climax excellently.Ramakrishnas art work, especially the set used for the climax, is commendable. Sris background score was apt for this kind of a film. Kotagiri Venkateswara Raos editing was fine too.Gopichand carried the film ably on his shoulders showing the necessary emotions. Taapsee has done well in the film especially in certain sequences like the Buzkashi. Shakti Kapoor plays the menacing don to perfection.

    "story": "The simple yet, inspiring tale of Srimanthudu is about the scion of a wealthy business family, who is disinterested in merely making money. His thoughts and later circumstances move him to adopt a nondescript village and develop it against various odds. A wealthy entrepreneur (Jagapathi Babu) is a worried lot owing to his sons (Mahesh Babu) indifferent and aloof attitude. He wishes his son to acquire and continue the monumental business empire that he built over his lifetime. But, the latter does not agree to it, stating that he wishes to acquire respect first. His thoughts lie elsewhere. He meets a girl (Shruthi Haasan) and they soon fall in love owing to the similarity in their thoughts. However, when she gets to know his identity, she simply ignores him. When confronted, she chides him that he is too rich and does not even know the place of his birth. She is later revealed to be the daughter of a benevolent village head (Dr Rajendra Prasad). Incidentally that is the same village. Later, the hero visits and adopts the village, financing and taking active part in construction of a school, roads etc. This brings him an inevitable clash with a selfish union minister and his brother, who grip the village in a reign of terror and fear. How the hero convinces his father and embarks on a difficult path forms thus, the crux of the story. ‚ÄîMass_SonuTollywood was suffering from routine formula storys.Writers were too afraid and directors were not willing to take any risk with new formulas.As a result we get to eat same stuff cooked in new bowl every Friday.But this Friday is different with srimanthudu.This movie deals with strong content which we dont usually get.That strong content is expressed with strong emotions with extraordinary actors.No forced comedy,No forced punch dialouges,No forced fights.Srimanthudu is very neat and i mean it in every different way.Koratala siva has mastered the village nativity and we should really thank him for what he was trying to do with srimanthudu.What words were left to describe mahesh babu.He is defeating himself in acting with every movie.Shruthi hassan was beautiful and she did her job very well.Music was soul of the movie.Srimanthudu song was played as background song in some scenes and every time this song is played,it was right on time.Jaago song was highlight of the movie.it changes the momentum of the movie and mahesh babus attitude in this song was like never seen before.Every body did beat in their job and result was srimanthudu.Plz dont miss this,because this type of movies,presented in every perfect way are rare in tollywood.",

Now he is Pulimurugan, but he has to face the tigers as well as the dangerous humans, as he is forced to move out of forest. This forms the rest of the story. ‚ÄîAkash M SWithout doubt,Pulimurugan was the most anticipated Malayalam movie this year that took two years in production taking its budget to a whooping 25 Crore making it the most expensive Mollywood film as per the makers.To my surprise,I was welcomed by the huge full-sheet paper ad this morning,first of its kind as far as Mollywood is concerned.Height of faith in ones creation??Ahh! Maybe.The movie started of with some stellar frames of the lush green forests,presenting the childhood back-story of Lalettan which was portrayed brilliantly by one debutant child artist,a promising prodigy to lookout for in future.Vysakh proved his mettle once again by presenting a normal formulaic storyline by Udayakrishna thats lifted up a level by the convincing narration and good screen presence of Mohanlal .The first half was really impressive with never-before seen breathtaking action sequences choreographed by Peter Hein,well-presented VFX,lovable performance by Mohanlal and hilarious counters shared between Mohanlal and Lal.The second half was little weak in comparison with the first,but made up to a large extent by the brilliantly presented climax fight sequence.Peter Hein deserves a special mention for those spine-tingling action sequences which for itself makes up for a delightful watch from the big screens.The VFX team did their part notably well,adding to the brilliance of the action choreography.The action sequences were top-notch and undoubtedly the best to comeout from mollywood till date.The initial and climax fights were the best part of the presentation and received huge applause from the crowd.On the negative side,the storyline was pretty predictable particularly to the second half that follows the normal pattern of masala entertainers that we have seen many a times before.The sub-plot involving Namitha,continuous praise of the protagonist by people around and a few double intenders could have been avoided to gain more pace and appeal among the family audience.The backgroundscore by Gopi Sunder was thrilling and boosted the appeal of the title character.Songs were average with the pick being the lullaby sung by Vani Jayaram.Shaji Kumar did a brilliant job behind the camera,elevating the impact of few trivial seqeunces on the silverscreen.Editing by John Kutty was fine.Coming to the performances Mohanlal was the backbone of the storyline and played the role of Murugan convincingly winning the hearts particularly in the emotional and action sequences.Another pic among the cast was the child artist who played the childhood part of Murugan brilliantly.Lal excelled with his amazing comic-timing.SurajVenjaramood,Vinu Mohan etc were good.Kamalini Mukherjee was okayish.Namitha didnt have much to perform than being the usual eye-candy as in her previous films.Jagapathy Babu was apt for portraying the role of the antagonist and portrayed his character effectively.Overall,Pulimurugan is a wholesome entertainer with some stunning stunts as the major highlight.",

Yeah, the story is only so-so but the characters keep your attention - both good and bad guys, and it is deceptively involving.The \"good guys\" in here are burlap-looking sewn puppets. Why they are who they are is explained near the end of the movie. The \"bad guys\" are the machines. Yes, this is familiar \"Terminator\" country, theme-wise, but the machines in this movie are brutal and scary. This movie is definitely not for little kids!If you keep your expectations in the \"fair\" range, and watch it on Blu-Ray, you should enjoy it. As mentioned, the story draws you in. On the other hand, if you are looking for something fantastic, you might be disappointed.",

There is so much attention to detail, that you are left gazing at the screen in awe. The 2 hours races by, and afterwards you are left with the satisfaction of having just seen something quite unique and surreal.Its a kids film of course, so there is little need to point out the predictable story elements - which exist in Cars more so than previous Pixar films such as The Incredibles. Cars is less daring, is safer in its approach. There are no surprising or wild deviations on the fairly straight road the story follows.

The first \"Cars\" film, was a great movie, not a perfect film. It was one of the least better films, Pixar has made, but thats like saying, Insomnia was one of Christopher Nolans worst films. I had high expectations when coming to see the film, like I always have before I see a Pixar film.After my viewing of the film, I have to say Pixar never fails to produce a great, entertaining film. Although it doesnt reach the heights of Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc. It still stands by itself pretty high up there. The animation is extremely well done, the look of the film is amazing. The voice actors are great, I miss Paul Newman though. Although the film is not perfect. The movie is not perfect though, the story is not great, but not bad, the movie does not have the emotional as other Pixar films, but it is definitely not a heartless film. But the film is definitely entertaining and a great beginning to 2011 Summer movie season. Take your whole family to see this movie, it will probably not disappoint. It will not only satisfy kids, but also the adults, this film is for everyone. Fun for kids, but the adults can also connect with it and will have a great time watching this movie in theaters. It is quite an adventure and I will be glad to give it a second viewing.",

Proving that #95 isnt through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racings biggest stage! ‚ÄîPixarI agree Cars 3 improves upon Cars 2, not by much though.The story for this does feel more rounded than the preceding film, even if it ends rather lamely. The whole production builds up around Lightning McQueen, rightly, before strangely having a conclusion that focuses on newbie Cruz Ramirez. I like the idea of what they were going for, but the way the do it is actually quite poor - it feels too forced, as well as chucking most of the development for McQueen across acts one and two out the window.With that said, it isnt a massive hindrance. I still had a fun time with this. Owen Wilson remains good as McQueen, while Cristela Alonzo gives an accomplished performance as Ramirez. One thing I do rate about Alonzo is that Disney didnt go down the obvious, lovey-dovey route with her.None of the rest of the cast standout all that much, though its cool to hear Kerry Washington as Natalie Certain. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is arguably underused, which is weird as he is overused in the 2011 sequel - they dont seem to know how to fit him in ideally.The overall premise itself is interesting, while the animation remains in top gear. The ending doesnt fit perfectly for me, but I can still recommend that you give this a viewing.",

This gets a little confusing at first with how we cant tell whether or now what were seeing is Nobitas dream or not. This is actually pretty unique for a Doraemon film. We actually get a really clear cut villain in it. I admit that it does get silly at times. Alright, I guess an anime about a cat robot is going to be like that, but I mean more so than usual. The characters in this look like members of Team Galaxy. Its just something with those green haircuts.It was pretty cool to see Nobita and Doraemon use their light weight to fight the villains. Well, they did have these guns, so I guess thats kind of like a cowboy, right? Im proud to be the first person to review these films. Im just that much into other cultures.

    "story": "Doraemon, Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo set out on an adventure in the Caribbean Sea. Nobita is the captain of a ship and fights his enemies on board. Shizuka gets kidnapped, and a storm impedes their journey. Mini-Dora help Nobita and friends on their journey. When the adventurers finally find the mysterious Treasure Island, they discover it is more than just an ordinary island. ‚ÄîKhush SidhuNo other animated character can claim to have had one big-screen feature each year for the past 12 years, but that alone is testament to the popularity of the time-travelling blue robot cat (not raccoon dog, mind you, which happens to be one of the running jokes in this movie). This 38th feature instalment in the Doraemon anime franchise sees the titular character and his boy companion Nobita embark on a seafaring journey to explore a mysterious island that has suddenly appeared off the southern coast of Japan, although when they eventually reach the volcanic land mass, they discover that there is more, much more, to the island than meets the eye.As penned by novelist Genki Kawamura (who produced some of the most successful Japanese feature animations in recent memory, like Your Name, Fireworks and The Boy and the Beast), the story deliberately draws from some of the more memorable references of Robert Louis Stevensons classic Treasure Island novel, so those who remember the book will certainly recall the pirate named John Silver, his talking parrot and the boy whom Silver is fond of. In any case, the opening minutes of the movie give a quick rundown of these references, just before Nobita wakes up from his daydream and muses how hed like to go on a real-life modern-day pirate adventure.Nobitas wish - and perhaps to an equal extent, his pestering - become Doraemons command, who pulls out a magical Treasure Hunter map to look for a yet-unexplored treasure island, as well as a miniature sailboat DIY kit and a magnifying glass to construct the square-rigged ship that they will use to reach the island. Nobita uses the Anywhere Door to ask his best friend and love interest Shizuka along, while the quick-tempered bully Gian and fox-faced rich kid Suneo invite themselves along the way. The quintet are also joined by the Mini-Doras, who prove resourceful as ever when the rest get into tight spots, so if youre keeping score, only Doraemons younger sister Dorami sits out this one. Without giving too much away, lets just say that Shizuka is kidnapped during their initial encounter with Flint and his band of pirates, owing to a striking resemblance she has with Flints younger daughter Sarah. At the same time, Nobita will pick up Flints elder son Flock, who reveals not only that he has run away from his father but also that Flint has some nefarious plan up his sleeve that will threaten the very fate and future of Planet Earth. Its not a literal adaptation of the book of course, but youll appreciate the generous creative liberties that Kawamura and director Kazauki Imai have taken with the source material, even turning Flints parrot into a chaperone robot named Quiz who likes to greet anyone and everyone he meets with riddles.Make no mistake, this isnt just a feature-length version of the Saturday morning cartoons youd probably acquaint the Doraemon character with; rather, Imais film is really a rollicking adventure fit for the whole family (except of course for the fact that youll have to be old enough to be able to read the subtitles to understand the dialogue). There is a genuine childlike sense of wonder and thrill every step of the way, thanks to Kawamuras inventive plotting as well as Imais rich and vivid visual imagination. There are loads of humour and witticisms, courtesy of Doraemons boundless gadgets and Quizs verbal puzzles. And last but not least, there is even surprising poignance at the end of it, as Silvers ostensible selfish motivations are revealed to be no more than misguided obsessions about completing his beloved late wifes legacy.It is no coincidence that Nobitas Treasure Island has since gone and become the highest grossing instalment in Doraemon history, seeing as how there is plenty here to entertain those among us who are growing up and those among us who had grown up with the lovable robot cat. In particular, the latter will probably find the conclusion unexpectedly moving just as we did, and in fact come to sympathise with how Silver just wanted to do right for the sake of his children and their future. Like we said at the start, no other animated franchise has been as prolific or enduring, and this latest film is itself reason why Doraemon is so beloved and will likely continue to be for generations to come. There is treasure indeed in this fascinating time-travelling tale of discovery, friendship and reconciliation, so embrace your inner child and hop on for the adventure!",

That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.I didnt read the book, so I dont know the story, witch might have suffered, as stories usually do from books to picture, but I think a writer couldnt hope for a better image, better portraits of characters, especially the black dragon who one definitely falls in love with - the mimic and the gestures and the face expressions, so complex and real. I agree its not the kind of movie that makes you keep thinking too much once its finished bot its not meant to be. Its just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and Im 22). The film wasnt too long, it didnt have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all.I dont know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again.

    "story": "Seven-year-old Tim Templeton has always had an overactive imagination--and for the past seven years--life has been all peaches and cream, getting all the love and affection from his caring parents. However, after the arrival of Boss Baby, an unexpected new brother dressed in a black suit complete with a tie and a briefcase, little by little, Tim realises that the cute newcomer has taken over the whole house, robbing him of his happiness. But, soon, Tim and the new boss in a diaper will need to put differences aside and join forces, as a sneaky scheme involving the head of Puppy Co. threatens to tilt the balance of power towards their insidiously adorable furry antagonists. Now, the next pet convention is only in two days. So, brothers, hurry up. ‚ÄîNick RiganasHes cute! He has got a big head! And he is in theaters this weekend. He is the Boss Baby and his movie is the focus of this review. Hi fans, Robbie K is back again with another review, and this time on the latest animation movie to hit the silver screen. What does this animated feature film have in store? Im happy to share some thoughts on the subject, so why dont we get started shall we? LIKES: ¬ï Good animation ¬ï Cute ¬ï Unique Twist on a story ¬ï Incredibly Fun ¬ï Funny and Clever ¬ï Movie ReferencesSummary: As you saw in the trailers, Boss Baby is another example of how incredible our animation technology is and this time it is wrapped up in a cute as a button package. This film may be one of the most adorable animation pieces to hit this year, and many will fall in love with the whimsical charm of this film. Now that we have the obvious wrapped up let us get to the real gold of this film. Its difficult to find a unique twist on a story, but the risk taken with Boss Babys story was well executed. The tale has many layers to it involving adapting to new family members, pursuit of your dreams, and of course what is better babies or puppies. With surprising detail and character development, the story is very entertaining and fun as baby and brother try to stop the dastardly puppies from taking over. And the best part is¬Ö the whole adventure is fun and fast paced, with seldom a boredom moment in this fast-moving flick. Lets hit the comedy now. Boss Baby again excels in this aspect providing a variable mix of comedic styles to entertain all ages. Young (and young at heart) will enjoy the simplistic comedy that involves the characters dropping mindless (meme-worthy) one liners, various screams of fear, and dopey run-ins with a wall. The real comedic diamonds though are the cleverer puns, one-liners, and adult references hidden in this movie. Alec Baldwins sarcastic delivery and edginess worked for me, adding just the right touches to maximize the laughs. Yet, Im a sucker for all the movie references integrated into this plot and how key they were to the adventure. And if you are nerd like me, you may get an extra thrill keeping your eye out for the next reference. DISLIKES: ¬ï Predictable ¬ï A bit of a stretch ¬ï A little preachy at times ¬ï More Babycorp use ¬ï Better EditingSummary: Despite how much I enjoyed the story, much of it is still predictable. Boss Baby has some surprising twists, but no manner of fun, can hide the blatantly obvious ending that is to come. While predictability is difficult to avoid, Boss Baby could have tidied things up a bit to give the finale a little more flare. In addition, they could have worked hard to not be so preachy near the end about the importance of family and all that lovey-dovey mush that animation films do all the time. Lets talk about some developmental issues I had with the movies. First off, the movie has moments that are a bit of a stretch. Yes, I know this movie is ridiculous and a stretch to begin with, but hear me out. Boss Babys adult cast are a bit idiotic at best, somehow not hovering over the newborns to hear them speaking. If that wasnt enough, some of the more dangerous stunts involved were also not as \"noticeable\", which after some point should have been discovered. Although fun, this ridiculousness didnt fit so much into the grand scheme of the plot. Next up is Babycorp, the organization the boss baby works for. This large plot point has dramatic build up and gets a large sequence to explain the wonders of this magnificent corporation. Yet after that, the film fails to deliver more on the potential plot points that could have come with it. Had the trailers not built up the baby vs. puppy rivalry as they did, I could have let this go, but with all the advertising I would have liked to see more of this. Finally, the editing of the movie. Boss Baby has a lot of great parts that foster imagination, love, and all those positive qualities we love in an animated movie. However, much of these moments were not necessary, often just extending the run time under the guise of character development. While I dont think they needed to eliminate these parts (after all it is only 90 minutes), they certainly could have altered these scenes to be a little more relevant to the adventure. The VERDICT:Despite all the lower scores, Boss Baby was an entertaining spectacle that is fun, funny, and clever at many points. This movie is certainly adorable and is the perfect family film (for all ages) to hit the screen this year. Yes, it is simplistic and silly, and doesnt have as much magic as a Disney film, but its nice to have unique, story that doesnt involve making a political ordeal out of it. This reviewer recommends this one for the theater for group outings and those with kids, but definitely check this one out when it hits homes. My scores are: Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",

    "story": "In a city park, Surly the Squirrel has finally gone too far with his latest caper . Now exiled, Surly and his rat buddy Buddys collective nightmare on the streets ends when they discover a nut store to raid. With no other options, she arranges a deal to help in Surlys heist for the colony, even while Surly fully intends to betray it. However, there is more going on with the nut store being a front for bank robbers while Raccoon has his own agenda to ensure his own power. In the mayhem to come, Surly finds himself challenged in ways he never expected and discovering the real prize to treasure in this adventure. ‚ÄîKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)Surly, an adjective and a name apparently, embarks on an adventure to obtain food for the approaching winter. He runs across some wacky characters and antics ensue. The Good: Art- The time spent on the animal and human designs was readily apparent throughout the film. I could pick out individual hairs in the animals coats. I also liked that the artists paid attention to the animals mouths. They were not just mere flaps of skin covering teeth, but it looked like the mouth region actually had some depth, that the lips were also 3D along with the rest of the animal. The humans had a distinct look and style about them that made me think of 2D cartoons. Big and imposing, shady and dangerous, cute and cuddly, the artwork certainly helped draw a person in. Ambition- The Nut Job tried to draw on several genres of film. It attempts to reshape these stories and form into a family friendly movie. I could spot a crime drama, a voyage of self discovery, a tale of redemption and rejoining society, just to name a few. The film also provided some rudimentary information about the animal species through dialogue, so it did have some educational moments. Whether or not the film succeeded in its ambitions will be covered in the not-so-good section. The Not-So-Good: Pacing- What a colossal mess. The Nut Job is a short 86 minutes and the film tried to show at least three different story arcs. The audience is not shown how the characters will respond to any event because the next event is following hot on the heels of its predecessor. Because of this, any connection or concern for the characters is lost in the fray of action and fart jokes...yes, Ill get there too. Characters- Unfortunately the pacing of the film allows the survival of only the most basic character types. Might as well forget about character development too. And learning. And change for the better. Comedy- I had hoped that the family film genre had grown past this, I really did. Situational and character-based comedy has made significant headway into the family films. Granted it may be a little silly to laugh at Mr. Potato-Heads parts stuck in a flour tortilla, but I found it to be incredibly funny. Or how about when a mermaid becomes a human and, as a result of misguiding information told to her in a previous scene, she puts a fork and a pipe to hilarious use at the dinner table. Fart jokes. Maybe with the compressed story arcs, the only form of comic relief could come from this. The Nut Job tried to meld several different genres and in so doing, did not execute any of them well. Youve seen better representatives of the genres attempted here and Id suggest seeing them instead. 4/10",

Thats when Jonny and his new furry friends spring into action! Get set for intrigue, thrills and suspense for the whole family. Tia Carrere and Tim Matheson lend their voices.Warner Bros have 3, maybe 4 lines of cartoon movies for the direct market. DC, Scooby Doo, Tom & Jerry and with the Flintstones vs WWE, maybe the Flintstones too. I have window shopping other T&J movies while waiting for this to arrive, and the cat and mouse team did Blast Off For Mars which is a similar title to Abbott and Costello Go To Mars. And like Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, in this movie we have a slapstick comedy team sliding effortlessly into an existing adventure franchise to bring a little comedy with out diminishing the adventure of the story. If you can like a pairing of Tom and Jerry with the Quest team, this movie does not disappoint. There are a few incredulous moments you have to go with, but as the action never lets up, they are super forgivable. And if you are a fan of Tom and Jerry, this movie has 3- 5 break-out scenes of cat and mouse tomfoolery. The movie opens with a Spike and Tyke cameo, and features visits from Droopy and Jezebel Jade. (Though disappointingly there is one animation of Droopy run twice the same way.) James Hong gives Doctor Zin a level of character never before seen, and will have you wondering if the voice isnt Ken Jeong. The character designs by Dan Haskett are wonderful in a very John K type of way, when Kricfalusi isnt trying to gross people out. This is giant piles of fun that never lets up. My hope is that this movie does so well that Jonny Quest will get more direct market movies and that, like the Mummy and Invisible man sequels to A&C Meet Frankenstein, Tom and Jerry might visit Space Ghost and The Herculoids. Thundarr The Barbarian would probably be a bridge too far, for a Tom and Jerry crossover. But if they made it, I would watch it.",

With the help of his tricked-out streetwise snail crew, this ultimate underdog puts his heart and shell on the line to prove that no dream is too big, and no dreamer too small. ‚ÄîDreamWorks Animation\"Turbo\" may not be the most original or inventive animated film ever but its a good time and pretty fun. The story is pretty simple and one that a little child can imagine. But the way it delivers the story is gorgeous. It has lovable characters and sense of humor. Theo (who prefers to be called Turbo) is a garden snail who lives as an outsider among his snail community. His dream of becoming the Indianapolis 500 champion makes him an outcast and his obsession with speed brings embarrassment to his brother, Chet. However, after an unexpected accident, Theo is granted incredible speed and also inherits some characteristics of an actual car (headlights, radio). He is then taken by a chubby guy named Tito. Tito and his brother Angelo own a taco shop that is struggling. The other tenants in the area are also facing the same problem. Tito has this idea of registering Turbo into the Indy 500 in order to help his business prosper. And there are also other snails who become Turbos buddies. \"Turbo\" may not have as much depth as some of the animated masterpieces. But \"Turbo\" doesnt aim in being that. It wants to become a fun-filled adventure about a freaking-fast snail racing in the midst of an array of monstrous cars. And it doesnt disappoint. Its enjoyable, slick and plenty of fun. The characters are likable too. Turbo is ambitious, funny, and adventurous. All the qualities of a fun character are embodied in him. Chet, his brother, is caring and more cautious but is also adorable in some moments. The other snails are also plenty of fun due to their ridiculous antics. Besides the mollusks, we also have the human characters. Tito, with his large build, is extremely chubby and funny. Titos other friends are also a joy to watch. \"Turbo\" also has a great sense of humor. I had a blast watching this film. Not all the jokes work, but most of them do. But I do want to mention that theres a joke concerning crows snatching one snail at a time, and to me it seems a bit extreme because the idea of a snail being eaten by a crow is kinda creepy, dont you think? Or maybe its just me. But the bottom line is \"Turbo\" is plenty of fun to watch. The animation is not the best Ive seen but its pretty good. It possesses beautiful sets and the colors are fluorescent. The voice cast was excellent too and Ryan Reynolds did a great job lending his voice to Turbo. \"Turbo\" is a fun and rollicking adventure and it is plenty of joy to watch these lovable characters see what theyre up to. Just dont expect too much from it and dont expect it to be a masterpiece. Rating: 7/10Final Verdict: It may not be original but \"Turbo\" is a hell of a roller-coaster ride that will provide plenty of joy and laughs with its lovable characters.",

I know why people are hating it so much\nFirstly, Most of the Indian viewers first watch movies like Judwaa 2, Dabangg 3, then the same people ask why films like Swadesh, Jagga Jasoos etc flopped. Basus movies are the victims of this, Basus movies are not so easy to understand, his films hide some messages that you understand after thinking a lot. That is why his films flopped because Indian viewers want item numbers as well as Oscars.\nSecond reason, Most of the Indian viewers love naked actresses dancing, liquor, cars, unrealistic cliche stories, some unrealistic happy ideal families with full of values, mockery of eunuchs on the big screen but if someone says anything about superstition (which pk, omg showed) about God, then they have problems. The movie did not say that God doesnt exist.\nHe said that your actions will decide the end of your life. We dont know whether there is hell and heaven or not, but we should always do our deeds, leave the consequences to God. The movie said that God is there, but dont do business in his name because your actions are the ultimate judge, wholl decide if youre made for heaven or hell.One star less because some scenes were confusing.",

Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning. ‚ÄîAnthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com>Its really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,its also a tremendous achievement for its director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say \"Im king of the world\" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.The modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Camerons real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kates Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.However,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,its schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.Titanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horners best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Roses fianc√©e,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}Overall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this.",

So she wants him to go and make sure no one can get out. He agrees. So they make the necessary preps but when Ray arrives at the prison, he discovers that someone doesnt want him to get out. He then tries to find a way out but he needs help. Another prisoner, Rottmeyer becomes friendly with him. And they decide to work together to get out. ‚Äîrcs0411@yahoo.comHaving grown up with the action movies of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, to name but a few, during my childhood and youth, then it is always refreshing to see these iconic action stars on the screen.Initially, I had some reservations about \"Escape Plan\", especially since this is the third prison movie of Stallones, and the synopsis for this movie didnt really promise something great.But I am glad that I saw it, because \"Escape Plan\" delivered the goods. This is a great action/thriller in every sense, and if you grew up with Stallone and Schwarzeneggers movies, then you definitely do not want to miss out on this one.The storyline, shortly summarized, is about Ray Breslin (played by Stallone) who goes undercover in secure prison facilities in order to test their security measures and prove that they are indeed not inescapable. Taking on a new job, Breslin finds himself in over his head in a very strange facility, where he has to team up with Rottmayer (played by Schwarzenegger) if he is to break free of captivity.The action sequences are great, as they always are with these guys. But what also made the movie so great, was the plot line and the revealing of what was really going on with the prison facility. That was a twist of events that I found really good.There are some great names to the cast list, aside from Stallone and Schwarzenegger, such as Sam Neill, Vinnie Jones and Vincent DOnofrio. Personally I cant claim to find any enjoyment in hip hop star 50 cents as an actor, and he is not one I would put my money on. But luckily his role is a minor one.\"Escape Plan\" is definitely a mans movie, full of action, testosterone (although not up to par with \"Expendables), and an interesting and well executed storyline. The movie is definitely well worth a watch if you enjoy action and thrillers.",

Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming. ‚ÄîWarner Bros. PicturesWhat is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywoods most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though hes increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: InceptionThen what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobbs brainiac specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a \"forger\" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You dont just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the Best Director category. If \"Inception\" is a metaphysical puzzle, its also a metaphorical one: Its hard not to draw connections between Cobbs dream-weaving and Nolans film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards",

For comparison, Fantastic Four had a budget of 120 million and the effects and so called set pieces were awful. This is one of the biggest problems with Hollywood, but thats a discussion for another day. The Maze Runner is actually a surprisingly entertaining movie. For an age in which the medium is flooded with young adult novels and movies, the film feels fresh and isnt overwhelmed by clich√©s like so many others are.Its led by a relatively unknown cast. Dylan OBrien, from Teen Wolf fame, is thrown into a maze structure along with a few dozen other young men who soon find there is more to the maze than they were led to believe. Let me be the first to say I think OBrien has some chops and definitely has a future in this business. The role doesnt require a ton of range, but I think he proved he can lead a huge action film, and not many actors can say that. The writing itself I thought could have been a little smarter and more mature. Will Poulter, who played a much different character in Were The Millers, was solid in the role that was given to him. But the writing had him doing some really stupid things and was full of forced dialogue I felt.With that being said, the mythology behind the story is pretty interesting. And they made the film into a more traditional monster film than Im sure the book originally called for, but it really works. The horror element to the film was by far the most intriguing, and had the biggest payoff. The Greavers also proved to be pretty terrifying, something I didnt think I would say about a film with a bunch of teenagers. So I really only watched this because Im probably going to see the sequel this weekend, and i ended up enjoying the movie. Plus, having Littlefinger as the next villain gets me pretty excited.+Monster flick+Surprisingly well acted+Suspensful-Some stupid dialogue7.2/10",

    "story": "The second chapter of the epic \"Maze Runner\" saga. Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and his fellow Gladers face their greatest challenge yet: searching for clues about the mysterious and powerful organization known as WCKD. Their journey takes them to the Scorch, a desolate landscape filled with unimaginable obstacles. Teaming up with resistance fighters, the Gladers take on WCKDs vastly superior forces and uncover its shocking plans for them all. ‚Äî20th Century FoxAfter escaping from the Maze, Thomas (Dylan OBrien), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa Agnes (Kaya Scodelario), Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alexander Flores) are welcomed by Mr. Janson (Aidan Gillen) in a protected facility. They meet other survivors from other mazes and they learn that everyday, a group of teenagers is summoned to be lodged in farms and communities in safe areas. However Thomas decides to investigate what happens with the teenagers and he meets Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland). Soon they find that the place is a WCKD facility and Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is alive and the leader of experiments with the teenagers that are intubated neither alive nor dead. Further, his group will be the next to be guinea pigs. Thomas and Aris succeed in escaping with the other Gladers from the facility and they decide to search the resistance group The Right Arm that is hidden at the mountains. Along their journey, they find the post-apocalyptic world completely destroyed; they meet the Cranks, zombies infected by the Flare virus; they have the loss of a friend; they face storm in the desert and a dangerous group of survivors; and they are betrayed by a friend. Now Thomas and his friends want revenge against the WCKD and Thomas promises to kill Ava Paige. \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" is a full of action sequel of \"Maze Runner. The story has a predictable plot point disclosing that one character is a traitor. There is no explanation why the teenagers needed to stay in the Glade and why the WCKD wanted them submitted to the situations against the Grievers of the previous movie. Maybe the explanation will be given on the next film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Maze Runner: Prova de Fogo\" (\"Maze Runner: Really Tough Test\").",

To save their friends, they must break into the legendary last city, a WCKD controlled labyrinth that may turn out to be the deadliest maze of all. Anyone who makes it out alive will get the answers to the questions the Gladers have been asking since they first arrived in the maze. Will Thomas and the crew make it out alive? Or will Ava Paige get her way?This film was a great finale for the Maze Runner triology series. Im not sure why all the hate, it was in line with the last film, yet still not as good as the first one. But certainly not worth all the 1s! Awesome special effects and cinematography, great directing and on point acting. Sure the ending was a little mushy, but still a great and enjoyable watch. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",

    "story": "Baby Bink couldnt ask for more; he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and hes just about to appear in the social pages of the paper. Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as Baby Binks parents; especially the three enterprising kidnappers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. Successfully kidnapping Baby Bink, they have a harder time keeping hold of the rascal, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than the three bumbling criminals. ‚ÄîMurray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>Despite being the heir to a small fortune Baby Bink has never had his picture in the paper like other rich babies.  However his mother hires a famous photographer to take his picture.  However when the photographers arrive they are actually kidnappers who steal away baby Bink and demand a ransom.  However Baby Bink manages to slip out of their sight and begins a journey through the city of his story book.  The kidnappers try to catch him but seem to be always one step behind.John Hughes wont be remembered in the same way as ¬ëgreat filmmakers will be - but like it or not, he knows how to do this type of film with his eyes closed.  This never gets above the same cartoon humour of Home Alone, but it still manages to be very funny.  The story is daft - the baby going through the city by recognising things from his story book, however the cartoon humour is very good throughout.  Some scenes (with the worried mother) and the ending cant help but lapse into sentiment, but for the most part its sheer comedy antics.The reason the comedy works is not due to the baby - he is cute but he never dominates the way Mulcaly Culkin did, instead he haplessly crawls his way around using `baby luck.  What makes it work are three really funny performances from the kidnappers.  One of my favourite actors Joe Mantegna is usually above this type of stuff, but hes really funny here.  Similarly Joe Pantoliano has been in his share of blockbusters and is funny here with Haley.  The support cast has its fair share of famous faces - Boyle is lumbered with all the emotional scenes and Matthew Glave (The Wedding Singer) doesnt have much to do.  An uncredited Mike Starr as an informant, Fred Dalton Thompson as the cop, Cynthia Nixon (Sex and the City) as the nanny and Anna Levine (Bad Boys, Unforgiven, The Crow) as an understanding mother make interesting appearances.  However when the kidnappers are off the screen things arent as good and start to drag.Overall you know what to expect from this.  If youre in the mood for Tom & Jerry style cartoon humour (as opposed to Jerry & Tom humour - Mantegna fans will understand!) then this is a really good laugh.  Simple, unmemorable but fun!",

    "story": "Luck hasnt always been in favour of Arjun, a gifted cricketer in his mid-thirties whose career has failed to take off. With everyone around him insisting that he should give up on his career, will Arjun have the courage of conviction to continue pursuing his dream?One of the best movie in recent times. Director Gautam Tinnanuri has delivered an excellent film and has used his abilities perfectly for his second film too. The screen play for this movie also looks similar as his first movie Malli Raava. Subtle performances by the cast Nani and Shraddha Srinath. Supporting cast Sathya Raj, Praveen etc. have also played their role with so much of life. The emotions between the Father and Son Relation is brought up amazingly. The climax is the Heart of the film. Music Director Anirudh Ravichander has given his one of the best ever songs and beautiful Background Score. Magical Scenes in some important and emotional places. The subtitle of this film \"It is never too late to dream.!\" is brought up beautifully in the climax. The only drawback I feel as a movie freak is the lack of concentration on the cricketing scenes and quite the story becomes a bit predictable. But totally a package of love, emotion, passion, journey. Must Watch Film for everyone.\nThanks,\nVijay Kashyap",

    "story": "Bound by an inescapable blood debt to the Italian crime lord, Santino DAntonio, and with his precious 1969 Mustang still stolen, John Wick--the taciturn and pitiless assassin who thirsts for seclusion--is forced to visit Italy to honour his promise. But, soon, the Bogeyman will find himself dragged into an impossible task in the heart of Romes secret criminal society, as every killer in the business dreams of cornering the legendary Wick who now has an enormous price on his head. Drenched in blood and mercilessly hunted down, John Wick can surely forget a peaceful retirement as no one can make it out in one piece. ‚ÄîNick Riganas\"John Wick: Chapter 2\" (2017 release; 122 min.) continues the adventures of former (?) hit man John Wick. As the movie opens, we are immediately thrown in the middle of a car vs. bike chase, and next thing we know, we find our man retrieving his beloved Mustang from a chop shop in NYC, but not without cars flying about, and dozens of dead or wounded bodies. And thats all in the pre-opening credits! As the story unfolds, Wick, who wants \"out, is nevertheless forced back \"in\" when an Italian baddie calls in a favor and Wick has no choice but to accept. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: director (and former stunt man) Chad Stahelski returns at the helm following the surprise success of the first John Wick movie, and once again delivers a highly stylish and ultra- violent action movie. When you watch the opening car chases (yes, in plural), its like watching a synchronized ballet performance. I would not go as far to say that the story line doesnt matter, it does to a degree, but lets be honest: the reason we are there is to watch the car chases and the shoot-outs and the almost cartoonish level of violence that is so over the top, you cant help but laugh at it. Stahelskis thinking must have been: \"when in doubt, (i) throw more bodies at it, and (ii) keep the focus on Keanu Reeves\". Reeves is cold as ice in the best possible way, and it suits him perfectly in the film. Laurence Fishburn plays a small role (as another baddie) and the scenes where Reeves and Fishburn appear together are their first joint scenes ever since the Matrix Trilogy, if you can believe it. I couldnt believe how quickly these 2 hours flew by and Im not spoiling anything when I tell you that the movies ending sets it up nicely for a Chapter 3 in a couple of years. Count me in!The movie opened wide this past weekend, and the Sunday matin√©e screening where I saw this at was absolutely jam-packed, somewhat to my surprise. Did I mention this movie is ultra-violent? And that its rated R for good reason? I was outright dismayed to see how many small kids were in the theater. In the very row in front of me, there was a couple with three small girls, Im guessing ages 5 to 7. What are these people thinking?!? Meanwhile, for us grown-ups, if you liked the first John Wick, you are more than going to like this sequel, you are going to LOVE it, be it at the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu- ray. \"John Wick: Chapter 2\" is a WINNER.",

    "story": "A school-teacher in India sires a son named Gurukant, but is disappointed as the child fails to live up to his high expectations. When Gurukant grows up, he is unable to secure decent employment in India, so finds a way to go to Turkey, where he finds employment. When he returns back to India, he wants to start his own business, but is unable to do so, as he does not have enough money. So he does some research, gets to meet Sujata, the daughter of a wealthy man named Jignesh, and marries her. After the marriage, Gurukant finds out that Sujata has a dark past, but he ignores this - for his one motive is to be to rise in the eyes of his father - and get rich. ‚ÄîCarrieThis movie celebrates Abhishek Bachachan, his fathers son. When you are the son of one of the best actors of the world of all times, you have the pressure to step into the shoes of your father. It doesnt happen often that a son matches up to his father in stature.In this film Abhishek Bahcachan does just that. He gives a performance his old man wouldve been proud of. Abhishek proves his pedigree. This is a difficult role. Not only because he has to portray a wide range in his character but also because his character has some of the cheesiest lines. But he makes you forget that the lines are out of place here and there. He goes flat out on this one, and gives a performance which is probably the best of this year. Probably matching up to Amitabhs in Black.About the film. Its a Mani Ratnam film, which raises the expectations immensely and nearly lives up to it. Its a well written story and direction is up to the mark. There is a slight problem with screenplay and the songs and dance sequences break the flow of story telling. A good film nonetheless and a great viewing.Though Abhishek steals the show; other actors are pretty good too. Mithun proves again why he is 2 times National Award winner. He is a legendary actor who has been wasting his time and talent in crappy movies for a long time now. Hope he would get better roles after this. Ash is good in the second half but her choreography is not up to the mark and she looks bland and unsophisticated while dancing. Vidya Balan is wasted and R Madhvan is good in a small role.A word about cinematography is necessary. This is one of the best shot movies of last year, with breathtaking views and the last scene with Guru giving his speech to a stadium full of people looks more real than reality itself.Over all a good movie, best since Munna Bhai 2.",
