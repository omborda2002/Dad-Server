    "story": "It was a normal school day for the students of a Korean high school-until a student returns from the schools science lab, infected by an unknown virus. As the infection spreads out of school and throughout the peninsula, the Military desperately interrogates the psychotic science teacher who started it all, while his students struggle to survive until help arrives.Beware as the show is extremely graphic and violent than youd expect! Squeamish people... dont even try. People who like a thrilling and fast-moving story... you guys are in for a ride. Every episode is over an hour and yet, they never feel lackluster. The characters are horror flick typical but theyre not dumbed down. The sound effects are amazing, and the zombie transformation scenes - no matter how repetitive they get - always look pretty insane! The cast are great and yes, theyre actually young actors cast as high schoolers (Hollywood take some notes!). Overall this is a neat addition to the zombie/survival genre. Another hit from South Korea.TW: Bullying / Sexual harassment / Attempted suicide.",

The movie is still magnificent to look but its pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters.",

    "story": "Married Alma spends a fateful weekend away from home that ignites passion, ends in tragedy, and leads her to question the truth about those close to her.As someone else described (in paraphrase) starts off well then gets stupid. Over use of flashback and delusional thinking to depict an unreliable narrator. It has so many characters flashing back to moments that didnt happen, its hard to tell them from the flashbacks/events that did. I dont know if the makers had to meet a minimum episode requirement, but the use of repeated scenes and the utter stupidity of some of the exchanges seem like filler.There are a few other noticeable flaws in writing. Are you married? (asked while the woman is wearing a bridal set with a huge diamond.) And the final pool scene - WTF happened there?!?!?My bigger peeve with the story is the depiction of - for the vast majority of the story - otherwise intelligent, accomplished women as becoming stupid after a good f*%&$k. On the other hand, the story closes out pondering that plot point, so, much like with the flashbacks, it feels like you - the viewer - were punkd. Im not sure if thats good or bad.Reminds me a bit of those B horror films that are so bad, theyre good. The makers knew this and are laughing all the way to the bank. Which is why it gets an 7 instead of 5.Overall, the mystery is gripping enough to make one want to hang around to see whodunit and why. But the urge to do something else while watching or fast forwarding is overwhelming.Oh, and that whodunit. Who = resolved. Well, at least one of them. Why = not so much - for all of them. Which sets the stage for season 2.",

According to Kathleen, Fantasy, Inc., guarantees its employees ironclad anonymity. But Grace has her doubts which are confirmed one horrifying cherry-blossom-scented night when one of Fantasy, Inc.s operators is murdered. As Grace is drawn to help solve the crime, her life turns into a scene from one of her own books. Yet as one of her biggest fans, investigator Ed Jackson, warns her: This isnt fiction. Real people die and Grace could be next. For shes setting a trap for a killer more twisted than anything she could imagine. And not even Ed may be able to protect her from a rendezvous with lust and death.This is disappointing to watch. Weve watched a lot of films featuring Alyssa Milano. And these are good ones while Alyssa is a competent actress. So, watching this film was an unpleasant surprise. The plot is predictable and it lacks that certain oomp and excitement that youd normally expect from a good thriller or a police procedural. And that love story between Grace and Ed seems so campy. At least, Melachi Nair as Ben made me smile. Hes subtly funny in his role as police detective.",

While I dont mind Linney as an actress, because shes a pretty good one, in this she plays an annoying know it all who doesnt appreciate everything Marty (Jason Bateman) has done for the her and the family.

Chastain tries to rectify her error by being involved in the creation of this wannabe franchise.Unfortunately for her the film is a perfect example of bland. The pacing is pedestrian, the plot non existent and the characters, for the most part, cypher. Chastain, as the main character, is the least interesting character and is far less charismatic than Lupita, Cruz and Kruger.All this could be compensated for if the film had spectacular action scenes like those performed by Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible series. The action is unimaginative and the exciting bits are obviously performed by stunt doubles. When the actors.",

With help from Mavis and the hilariously human Drac Pack, the heat is on to find a way to switch themselves back before their transformations become permanent. ‚ÄîSony PicturesHotel Transylvania: Tranformia is an incredibly lazy film about to be released on Amazon Prime. I say incredibly lazy because the plot is essentially the previous movies! For example, in the original Hotel Transylvania, the vampire father has trouble accepting his incredibly annoying human son-in-law to be. Here in the fourth film, the son-in-law is married to Dracs daughter...and dad is STILL having trouble accepting him. The story seems to say its because of the fathers prejudices, but to me it seemed more because the son-in-law was incredibly annoying and addle-brained.So what did I like about this film? Well, the animation is nice. Other than that, the story seems to scream made to be aired directly on DVD or a channel like Netflix or Amazon Prime. Younger kids will likely enjoy it...and parents watching should probably have some knitting or a laptop handy as the film will bore them if theyve seen the previous films, as the story has nothing in the way of innovation or originality.",

Two guys find a massive gold nugget (that looks nothing like a gold nugget). But the acting and everything else was subpar. I watched it till the end and parts of it didnt make sense. The parts of it that did make sense werent really enjoyable. By the way, who thought casting pretty boy Zac Efrom as a prospector in the outback was a good idea?

Their mission is to retrieve a mysterious sample from an abandoned research station. ‚ÄîbilalkamaranI am not a fan of sci-fi or space drama/thrillers but as a fan of S. Korean movies and TV series, I gave it a watch. Overall, its slow-burning with a somber mood, different from other sci-fis of this kind giving out a realistic feel of their challenges, no aliens or creatures about but something more mysterious and deadly, with intriguing twist and turns and you have to watch all the episodes patiently to really experience the show. There is also a very important message - climate change and the effects on future generations like water shortages which can easily happen if not already. Some of the acting surprisingly was not up to par for me but maybe because this whole project was a complete new experience for all involved. I think, the show would have been better with fewer episodes but for a new director and first attempts at this kind of genre, I was really impressed and enjoyed the show.However, I like to point out somethings based on the comments/reviews I have seen a lot lately (Squid Game, Hellbound, My Name, etc.):1) There is so much comparing every recent S. Korean show that comes out to Squid Game. Even the reputable sites that review films/TV shows are doing it. Its ludicrous and at this point aggravating as if all recent S. Korean shows must somehow be like Squid Game to be worthy or thats all they have to offer!2) I have seen some reviews that seem suspicious and generic whether rated high or low. Sadly, I have even seen few racist ones!! Not sure even any of these ratings were based on actually watching the shows??3) There is always some comparing the shows from other countries to Hollywood ones as if that is the ultimate standard. International shows have become very popular in recent years so they must be doing something right. Viewers these days, at least some, are looking for something really original, unpredictable and emotionally engaging and with natural acting and great character build up/storytelling (fast or slow-burning) which is offered more in international films and TV series than the Hollywood productions. You can find reviews/comments to that effect as well.Anyways, I definitely recommend watching this show because it has a new approach to this type of genre. South Korean filmmaking can be very innovative and this too does not lack in some originality,",

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.

That also they couldnt do properly.Up on that its just star kid career launching movie. But do he able to deliver that. Nope!!!I am not saying to give this script to some other actor or any known actor but. But at least they could have done properly with screenplay.Dialogues are ridiculous. No one talks like a normal person in this movie. Every one is giving a speech or some kind of lecture to each other.I am not a fan of Tara Sutaria. She cant act. Up on that her choice of script or movie selections has been horrible. This movie might be her best choice. But she cant deliver lust full, nymphomaniac character. Also an evil personality which she needs to do. That demands years of tough characters portraying actress with young age. There are so many actress we have seen in recent years in OTT web series.I am not a fan of Tadap music Album also. Its annoying and very forgettable music and songs.Only one song plays repeatedly in the whole movie.Better to listen RX100. It had soulful music.Compare to Tadap music album, RX100 is a masterpiece music album with such beautiful sound design.",

    "story": "Set in a high fantasy world where magic exists, but only some can access it, a woman named Moiraine crosses paths with five young men and women. This sparks a dangerous, world-spanning journey. Based on the book series by Robert Jordan.The acting is actually very good but they can only do so much when the writing is aweful.Some of the story changes are understandable, but most times the changes are nearly incomprehensible dont seem to serve a purpose. Additionally, there are a couple of moments that the writers make very poor story choices resulting in at least one instance of using the sin of   Deus Ex Machina   to escape their own story traps. This is lazy writing at its worst.There are also fundamental changes to the main and side characters along with fundamental changes in relationships between people and organizations. This is another major writing sin and seriously jeopardizes eliminating or watering down both major and minor themes of the original story. Inexcusable.There are other issues with poor site locations. A good example of this is picking a river next to a cliff to represent a part of a river delta for the largest river in the world. REALLY?I gutted this season out and watched every episode from beginning to end so I could give the show an honest shot and not be one of tgose people that posts an opinion based on ignorance.Season 1 did have a few moments that were at least decent, but not enough to make up for the rest of its considerable flaws and sins, therefore, I will NOT be watching season 2.",

    "story": "Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence), an astronomy grad student, and her professor Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) make an astounding discovery of a comet orbiting within the solar system. The problem - its on a direct collision course with Earth. The other problem? No one really seems to care. Turns out warning mankind about a planet-killer the size of Mount Everest is an inconvenient fact to navigate. With the help of Dr. Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan), Kate and Randall embark on a media tour that takes them from the office of an indifferent President Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her sycophantic son and Chief of Staff, Jason (Jonah Hill), to the airwaves of The Daily Rip, an upbeat morning show hosted by Brie (Cate Blanchett) and Jack (Tyler Perry). With only six months until the comet makes impact, managing the 24-hour news cycle and gaining the attention of the social media obsessed public before its too late proves shockingly comical - what will it take to get the world to just look up?. ‚ÄîNetflixTwo astronomers discover a massive comet heading towards Earth. The comet will wipe out mankind in six months time if nothing is done about it. They manage to gain an audience with the US President, land on TV talk shows and have their story printed in the media but everyone seems to have other priorities.On the surface a disaster movie in the vein of Armageddon or Deep Impact. However, it is not just that and is far better than that.Written and directed by Adam McKay (The Big Short, Vice, The Other Guys, Anchorman), Dont Look Up is a funny, accurate examination of the warped priorities and agendas of the people who have the largest control over our lives. Politicians care more about how something will impact their polling numbers than saving mankind, the media cares more about finding something slanderous on a person than alerting people to imminent destruction, talk shows care more about sensationalism, the personal lives of vapid pop stars and on putting on a happy face than on news that actually matters to people, corporate opportunists who use even a planet-destroying disaster to make a profit and in so doing increase the danger (and how the politicians fall in line behind them).It is all quite chillingly accurate and plausible: from experience you can relate to the misguided, self-absorbed agendas of these institutions and individuals and the powerlessness and irritation you feel in having to deal with them and their decisions.It is so close to home that it sometimes makes the film irritating to watch: youd rather not be reminded how incompetent, superficial, self-servicing and nefarious the government, media etc are, how they screw up your life on a regular basis and how likely it is that they will eventually wipe out mankind.All this makes for a film that is one part hilariously funny and another part scarily serious and confronting. Unlike some other movies I did not find this mix of comedy and drama jarring. In fact, the humour helps point out the absurdity of it all.By the way, keep watching until the very end. Theres two scenes woven into/after the credits that are worth sticking around for.",

    "story": "Manu, a bodybuilder from Chandigarh falls in love with Maanvi, a Zumba teacher. All seems well until a shocking revelation causes turmoil in their love story.Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui (2021) : Movie Review -Ayushmann Khurrana is on a dream run. The kind of cinema he is making consistently, puts him in a different league of his own- far away from his contemporaries. Looking at his recent films, nobody can deny that, rather we are getting used to it. Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui is yet another   Taboo-Breaking Entertainer   in Ayushmann Khurrana Club, a single member club which is established by him, run by him and is being ruled by him and him only. While others are busy making mainstream cinema even more typical, this guy is busy in reforging mainstream cinema by mixing commercial elements with taboo but socially important subjects. Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui is his Trademark Entertainer! But wait, we have a big surprise, The Vaani Kapoor. Abhishek Kapoor dares to make a love-story which hasnt been made in Bollywood yet and his attempt is definitely watchable, with those expected flaws.The film is about Manu (Ayushmann Khurrana), a gym owner and a bodybuilder who falls in love with Zumba teacher Maanvi, played by Vaani Kapoor. Everything goes smoothy until one sudden moment when he learns the truth about Maanvis past which shatters him mentally and physically. The surprise must be enjoyed without any spoilers so lets not reveal anything here. The screenplay is quite engaging and pacy with the entire first half unfolding lots of things within an hour. That leaves second half with no surprises and predictable happy ending but its pretty a speech-maker and learning experience. The film deals with the topic which may not be accepted today, especially by the family audience but surely after 40-50 years, it will get that deserving appreciation. If the second half had something more to show, this would have been a fantastic affair afterall.Ayushmann Khurrana is fantastic as Manu. The film shows him in a macho avatar, something he hasnt done before. The female fans are gonna scream out for him. But lets not forget the main reason behind it. He plays that egoistic macho who learns the actual meaning of being a   MARD  . Thats where he wins the battle by losing one. His companion, Vaani Kapoor is a complete surprise package. You might just think it for a moment that this role was meant to be played by her only. No other actress could have done it better and the way she fearlessly delivers those dialogues will force you think about that never-ending pain, problems and struggle. The supporting cast gets a lot of laughter, to be frank, much more than the leading pair.Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui has got a very good music album which is filled with local flavours and romance. That foot-tapping title song appears with the end credits, unfortunately. Kheench Te Nach and Tumbe Pe Zumba are pretty nice situational grooving numbers whereas Kalle Kalle is practically very effective song. The film has got good dialogues too. Some are typical one-liners while some are intelligently hard-hitting, which might leave family audiences feel uncomfortable. Director Abhishek Kapoor tries his hands in some kind of new genre with the brand ambassador of the club Ayushmann and he successfully manages to present the taboo context without any compromises. The film falls flat at some occasions where it couldnt battle out the predictability and few of those typical hindi cinema cliches. But the fact that you cant really go too intellectual while making a commercial cinema saves a lot of bashing. You need to to little bashing where its due. For instance, the family affair, completely unnecessary and over-dramatic. That sister eavesdropping with Stethoscope, seriously? How dumb it looked. Nevertheless, its a nice attempt by Abhishek Kapoor which will help him to change his image too. He brings us the most surprising love-story of recent times and a new form of progressive cinema. Ayushmann Khurrana and Vaani Kapoors   Taboo-Breaking Aashiqui   is unmissable for content cinema lovers who have that hunger of watching something new, something really interesting. However, it also tries to be formal audience at the same time, so you might hate that part so prepare yourself for that. Rest, its enjoyable. Far better than recent So Called good films (after re-opening), content-wise i mean.RATING - 6/10*",

Then there was the film itself, which consistently felt less evolved, in both effects and fight choreography, than the original film *from 22 years ago!*. Last but not least, there were the characters. Keanu and Carrie-Ann aside, the rest of the people had no characterization at all and the actors, some I knew from other stuff like Sense8, had less to work with than in the TV series they were grabbed from. Remember how awesome Max Riemelt was in Sense 8? Here he was a yes man with a bad accent. Remember how amazing and fun Lambert Wilson was in the original Matrix films? Here he was no more than an obscenity spouting homeless crazy person. I think Jonathan Groff did a reasonable job, but his character was all over the place. And so on.I dont want to touch on the sexual orientation of most of the actors or the agenda that is always pushed by the Wackowskis, because it doesnt really matter here. Put all that aside and its still a mess of a film.Bottom line: if it were a random low budget scifi, it would have been average. As a sequel to The Matrix, it has great potential and it failed miserably.",

As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planets exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence-a commodity capable of unlocking humanitys greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will survive. ‚ÄîWarner Bros.Its definitely a well-directed film. The music is beautiful and the desert views intended to show us the planet Arrakis are impressive. But unfortunately, there is practically nothing behind the beautiful exterior. Even if Villeneuve filmed only half of the first book, this half was supposed to introduce us to the universe and many main and secondary characters. Unfortunately, the duration of 2.5 hours for the director was only enough to briefly introduce the main characters and slightly describe the situation in the galaxy. Too little time has been given to supporting characters. Some are presented, but not disclosed. Especially disappointed by Liet-Kains, his line was cut to almost zero.Bottom line.The universe of Dune is very extensive and it is extremely difficult to film even one book in less than 3-4 films with a similar timing.It would be better if they made a series. With a budget like Game of Thrones. They would most likely be successful .A film can only be watched for the sake of a beautiful picture and wonderful music.5/10.Sorry for the mistakes.

They face trouble from local politicians and from the people of the village who constantly criticize the teams poor efforts in capturing the tiger.Sherni is not everyones cup of tea. Knowing that it is directed by   Newton   director Amit Masurkar , you should not expect it to be a spine chilling animal hunt. However, this film aims at promoting animal conservation rather than killing them. There are so many who get affected by tigers and want them to be dead, but should they really be killed? That one emotional scene from the climax will prove it that tigers too have a life. You may not be able to train tigers to respect humans by not killing but that doesnt mean we dont respect them, that would leave no difference between us and the tigers.The film does have some interesting points especially when Vidya and her team are out for capturing the tiger, rest every part relies on conversations and tribal rage.The tribal cast like Sampa Mandal deserve special applause especially for their stellar natural performance. Their performances make sure you get the feeling of being in a forest tribal region. Vidya Balan roars! She doesnt shout too much but her dialogues do the roaring. Vijay Raaz, Sharat Saxena (hes the one that the film aims to be against), Neeraj Kabi etc all have done a good job as well.Negatives - Mukul Chadda is wasted here and his parts could have been avoided. Some scenes of politics could have been avoided.Overall, a must watch film for those interested in knowing what happens in the jungles and the tribal people and since it has a message, you definitely should watch it.",

    "story": "1916. Dreaming about saving countless lives and having another adventure, the feisty English feminist and doctor of botany, Dr Lily Houghton, embarks on a peril-laden mission to change the world. Along with her fashionable brother, MacGregor, Dr Houghton enlists the help of the arrogant, wisecracking riverboat skipper, Captain Frank Wolff, to guide them through the serpentine Amazon River in La Quila, his swift wooden boat. Now, as the intrepid trio ventures deeper and deeper into the heart of an impenetrable green maze, searching for something that cannot be found, a centuries-old curse and the ruthless aristocrat, Prince Joachim, threaten to put an end to their ambitious plans. And, sooner or later, the jungle always wins. Is it true that the Spanish conquistador, Don Aguirre, was lost in the same God-forsaken part of the world? ‚ÄîNick RiganasJungle Cruise is the latest Disney live-action film. The director is Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed many entertaining Liam Neeson action flicks. Glad to say, the direction is gorgeous here.Despite being type-casted, Dwayne Johnson gives a very likable and charming performance. His character and Emily Blunts scientist character is the best aspect of Jungle Cruise. Their chemistry is very enjoyable.Now there are some dumb Disney jokes, obviously for younger audience to have fun. The jokes are mostly presented by the comic relief character, McGregor.The three main cast work well, but unfortunately not the villains. There are 2 groups of villains, one is the Germans, the other one is some supernatural trope of people. Why cant there just be one?The film asks you to believe a lot of things. Theres a certain thing explored about a character in the 2nd act that just didnt work for me. Youll know what Im talking about when you see it.The movie at times feel like a Disney ride, which is its source material. Jungle Cruise is perfect for people who want a CGI-filled fun ride.",

This sequel is a loud and frantic mess, where superpowers can do whatever the plot demands, characters dont care about consistency, and the same jokes are repeated a dozen times.

While she does have friends like Suhaani who lives downstairs and Aatmaram, the friendly ghost of a singing sensation who has been her companion for 10 years, Lallo now wants to go out to the outside world and find her suitor. She manages to convince her employer Bahuji to let her leave the house for some time, hoping to find her match in a fast-food joint - after all it happened to the girl in her favourite novel. But she is disappointed when she finds no one. Bahuji passes away unexpectedly, leaving the house in Lallos name. Bahujis relatives are furious and go to the police to complain about it, alleging that Lallo inheriting the house is fishy. As the police investigation begins, Lallo tries to find true love in every man she meets. But strange things start happening. Whoever she starts liking, dies in the most bizarre way. Trying hard to be like the rest and fit in, Lallo gets herself a makeover which draws the attention of multiple men. But one by one, they all die in mysterious accidents. An old novel she found in the attic convinces Lallo that she is a Lal Pari, someone who is cursed that her suitors die as soon as they fall in love with her. As part of the police investigation, plain-clothed cop Vikram comes to live in Lallos house as a paying guest. Vikram finds Lallo innocent of all the deaths as the evidences turn out to be circumstantial and not connected to Lallo. In the process, Vikram gradually and secretly falls in love with Lallo. Will Lallo find her fairytale true love or is she cursed to roam the earth alone? Will Vikram be able to solve the case and declare his love for Lallo? ‚ÄîPromita MukherjeeDifferent kind of bollywood Romantic movie where neha is so innocent in the movie & the character of Deepak Dobriyal was too good, so overall it is not a must watch movie if you dont have enough time you skip the movie...üòçüòçüòç",

Dont listen to any of the critics on this for sure because this show is anything but predictable.I myself am an avid fan of cinema and have watched stuff across many genre and can testify that this is a new and original show with characters, dialogues and storyline to die for.Every review that you read will praise Pankaj Tripathi, even the bad ones and he deserves it but i guarantee you that have never seen Ali Fazal like in this show and for me he stole every second of his presence and even scenes with Pankaj Tripathi.",

    "story": "Set on the night of February 25, 1964, One Night in Miami follows a young, brash Cassius Clay as he emerges from the Miami Beach Convention Center the new Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the World. Against all odds, he defeated Sonny Liston and shocked the sports world. While crowds of people swarm Miami Beach to celebrate the match, Clay - unable to stay on the island because of Jim Crow-era segregation laws - spends the evening at the Hampton House Motel in Miamis African American Overtown neighborhood celebrating with three of his closest friends: Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown. During this historic evening, these icons, who each were the very representation of the Pre-Black Power Movement and felt the social pressure their cross-over celebrity brought, shared their thoughts with each other about their responsibilities as influencers, standing up, defending their rights and moving the country forward to equality and empowerment for all black people. The next morning, the four men emerge determined to define a new world for themselves and their community.This just became available on Amazon streaming movies. The one night reference is Feb 25th, 1964 in Miami, the night Cassius Clay (22), (later known as Muhammad Ali), surprised boxing fans by defeating Sonny Liston who threw in the towel after 6 rounds.The four prominent friends were Malcolm X, Cassius Clay, Jim Brown, and Sam Cooke. You see, I was in college at that time, all of them are were known to me, so seeing this stage play turned into a movie has a very relevant meaning.Although it is based on a true story of real people, unfortunately there are no tape recordings of their conversations that night, and some facts were changed for dramatic effect, so it isnt possible to determine how accurate it is. Nonetheless it is a good depiction of the times and what these black men were facing, and some of the 1960s drive to overcome the rampant discrimination that existed. Of course the issue still isnt behind us, there is still a ways to go.This is a good movie, especially for those of us who remember those days. I find myself wondering how it comes across to the younger (under 60) age groups.",

Instead it was pretty much the opposite of all of those things. The Rock was given almost no opportunity to show off his undeniable charm. The script just hampered him in every way and left him as nothing more than a muscly guy who could do impressive stunts. But trust me, The Rock is the least of the problems this film has.The biggest gripe I have is just how dull it is. The film actually starts off with a pretty menacing villain and some violent and brutal killings. At this stage I had hope for the film, but all of that ended pretty abruptly and from that point onwards every bad guy in the film was unbelievably incompetent. The whole story arc plays out in about as cliche of a fashion as you could ever imagine. Its all very underwhelming and disappointing.As for positives they are hard to come by. Some of the visuals are impressive and The Rock does his best to keep things watchable despite being given absolutely no help. Otherwise though I would say this is a complete misfire and not worth anyones time or money.",

Dr. Kerry Atkins, the lone surviving crew member, is ordered by CEO Claire Wyden to retrieve research canisters containing a pathogen.

He has befriended a rare albino western lowland gorilla named George, having saved him from poachers, and communicates with George using sign language and hand gestures. At night, one of the canisters crash-lands in Georges habitat, and George is exposed to the pathogen..Appreciate this film for what it is: fun, mindless, action-filled entertainment. No need to dissect, analyse or compare this. My only few complaints are that the writing was too loose and should have been edited down by 15-20 mins to keep the pace more elevated throughout. Also, not a fan of the Energyne CEO sister and brother characters - they were way too cheesy and annoying and cheapened the film. All other actors were cast and performed great, and Dwayne entertained as always. The SFX/VFX were also great. A fun and well deserved 8/10 from me",

    "story": "Former wrestler Ricky and his wife Julia make a living performing with their children Saraya and Zak. When brother and sister get the chance to audition for WWE, they learn that becoming a WWE Superstar demands more than they ever imagined possible.Full disclosure first, I am a wrestling fan and I knew the majority of Paiges story and how the WWE and pro-wrestling works before seeing this.The Knight family love professional wrestling. It has changed the lives of Julia (Lena Headey) and Ricky (Nick Frost) and their passion has transferred to their three children, particularly to their son Zak (Jack Lowden) and daughter Saraya (Florence Pugh). Having grown up performing for the families Norwich based federation, a shot at the big time comes when both children are asked to attend try-outs for World Wrestling Entertainment.All that said, you dont really need to know anything about wrestling to enjoy   Fighting with My Family  . Its a relatable story of someone from an unlikely background overcoming the odds to find success far from home. Its has a very British sense of humour, with lots of jokes with swearwords or about class differences, both between the Knights and Zaks prospective in-laws and between Paige and her peers once shes over in the performance centre. It probably has slightly too much swearing to be a real family film, but is still pretty gentle in its overall tone and themes. What makes the film successful is the performances of actors in the key roles. Frost and Headey are great, as is Florence Pugh, who continues to be a star on the rise after her performance in   Little Drummer Girl   last year. Its Jack Lowden, however, who has the most to do and excels with it, dealing with the disappointments and temptations that his life gives him as a parallel to his sisters.That perhaps leads to me the films biggest weakness, despite how unlikely it seems, Paiges journey isnt perhaps that extraordinary. Shes way more talented and experienced than any of her colleagues but struggles a bit to overcome her own awkwardness. Its not so much an emotional rollercoaster as it is a jittering ski lift. To combat that, we get the opposing journey of Zak which, if anything, is actually more interesting, as he struggles with fatherhood, disillusionment and jealously before coming to terms and reconciling with his family.  Fighting with My Family   is an entertaining and funny film if a little slight and though I cant imagine its going to be anybodys favourite film of all time, its a lot of fun to watch and Im sure would be enjoyed by anyone.A little bonus if you are a fan of the UK wrestling scene from the past few years is spotting cameos from current stars. Dave Mastiff and Kip Sabian are two of the most obvious but theres a few more (and a dig a Pete Dunne which is funny, if slightly confusing).",

One day, when 400 Talibans rallied for a surprise attack, it was up to them to leverage the poor defenses and lack of ammo and manpower they had, to ultimately survive and go back to their loved ones. ‚Äîheyitsnuel  The Outpost   is surprisingly a well executed, well acted and intense film about the war in Afghanistan. I was hooked from beginning to end. . In this war drama based on a true story, a small team of U.S. soldiers battle against hundreds of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. . Director Rod Lurie takes the viewers inside the outpost rarely ever showing the enemy but always showing the bond between brothers. Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones are terrific in their roles and the action sequences are pulse-pounding. I started this review off with the word   surprising  ; and being a B-movie I didnt expect much from   The Outpost  . Turns out I was wrong and you should see this film. .

He nails them to perfection with proper entertainment value. 2.0 is the true Indian superhero, with a lot of potential future projects.Akshay Kumar: His dedication is impressive. His acting in the flashback portion is very natural and he deserves an applause for accepting that character.AR Rahmans BGM and Nirav Shahs camera work lift the movie to another level.Negative: An underwhelming and weak storyline that is easily predictable. Screenplay is flat, without any interesting cat-and-mouse moments between the protagonist and antagonist.Given that most of the superhero films in the Hollywood too have such simple and predictable storylines, the only negative of the film can be magnanimously ignored.Go watch this indigenous product, that will definitely make you proud as an Indian!",

Six months later, he comes across the Life Foundation again, and he comes into contact with an alien symbiote and becomes Venom, a parasitic antihero.You would think one of the 5 (why?) writers could have gotten this right. Tom Hardy was amazing, the directing excellent, cinematography on point, V/SFX not bad, but the story was very loose and had plot and pacing issues. Venoms voice was also annoying. You would think the producers would have hired better writers instead of pathetically paying for almost every review on here 9 and above being fake (pretty much only film reviewed). I may have given this film a 7 or 8 out of 10, but only gets a 6 for the fake reviews. For me it could have been much better and deserving of the 9s and 10s had the writing been tighter. Nevertheless, still enjoyable, but sadly only a 6/10 from me, mainly for the fake reviews that piss me off.",

The dialogues are hilarious and keep you entertained throughout. The plot gets a bit predictable towards the end and the film glorifies government schools, which are looked down upon in our society. A little preachy and over-dramatic towards the end, Hindi Medium strongly drives its point home.My Rating : 3.5/5",

As his high school reunion approaches, he tries to make contact with his old schoolmates. And someone named Bob Stone contacts him. He says that he was known as Robbie Weirdicht in school. Calvin remembers that he was picked on, as a matter of fact after an extremely nasty prank he left school. They agree to meet and Calvin is surprised by how much he has changed. Bob asks Calvin to help him out. He says yes and the next thing he knows some men burst into his home. Theyre CIA, the one in charge is looking for Stone, she says hes a rogue agent. When they cant find Bob they leave. Later he approaches Calvin telling him, he is not a rogue agent, hes trying to find a person known as the Black Badger who is planning to sell some information that in the wrong hands can be disastrous. so he needs Calvins help to stop him. Calvins not sure whom he should believe. ‚Äîrcs0411@yahoo.comHere comes another buddy cop film,this time with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart in the lead roles.I thought this movie would fail miserably.I thought it was ripping off Ride Along(which is not a good film to rip off) but it surprisingly stands on its own and makes for a fun time at the movies.Bob Stone asks his old classmate,Calvin Joyner to help him with his computer skills.I dont really like Kevin Hart all that much,because he plays the same character in every film and even though he does have acting skills,he goes OTT in every performance.But his character is a bit more serious in this one and Dwayne Johnson is awesome as ever in his role.The main strength of this movie is the chemistry between the 2 leads.They are so much fun to watch.One is a fearless agent and the other a normal guy who cant even hold a gun.There are some nice jokes and gags as well.On the downside,the film falters sometimes in the plot section.Yet another OTT performance by Kevin Hart(as mentioned above) I wish the action scenes had a bit more lustre in them.But do not be bothered by that because this is the action junkie in me speaking,and you may like this movie more than I did.This movie isnt completely flawless,nor is it totally groundbreaking in the buddy cop genre.But it is still worth watching in the theatre,thanks to the chemistry between the 2 leads and a lot of laughs.",

Ronnies dad is every dad I know, especially my own. The small nuances in dialogue and setup is truly commendable.

Their company quickly grows from a staff of 20 to a staff of more than 250 and their status in the trading community and Wall Street grows exponentially. So much that companies file their initial public offerings through them. As their status grows, so do the amount of substances they abuse, and so do their lies. They draw attention like no other, throwing lavish parties for their staff when they hit the jackpot on high trades. That ultimately leads to Belfort featured on the cover of Forbes Magazine, being called   The Wolf Of Wall St.  . With the FBI onto Belforts trading schemes, he devises new ways to cover his tracks and watch his fortune grow. Belfort ultimately comes up with a scheme to stash their cash in a European bank. But with the FBI watching him like a hawk, how long will Belfort and Azoff be able to maintain their elaborate wealth and luxurious lifestyles? ‚Äîhalo1kBrilliantly acted, superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese, it is a masterclass of directorial craft.Showy when it needs to be, but also quiet and contemplative.   The Wolf of Wall Street   is the equivalent of something like   Good Fellas   or even more so   Casino   but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stones   Wall Street  .Where Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.Leonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.Its a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.One could almost hear Scorseses clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.It is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference. For every individual but also society as a whole.",

I thought that the movie was dramatic most of the time about 80%, which kept it on edge. Also I found it quite hilarious how they managed to use a lot of different types of transport including plane, helicopter, car and boat! Well done if it was a competition to include that :D I was expecting a train soon!

    "story": "The true story of Londons most notorious gangsters, twins Reggie and Ronnie Kray. As the brothers rise through the criminal underworld, Ronnie advances the family business with violence and intimidation while Reggie struggles to go legitimate for local girl Frances Shea. In and out of prison, Ronnies unpredictable tendencies and the slow disintegration of Reggies marriage threaten to bring the brothers empire tumbling to the ground.It is true that glasses and change of hairdo can actually produce a different personality. This movie is mostly dedicated to Tom Hardy delivering his excellent, albeit slightly and funnily schizophrenic, acting prowess. As far as biopic goes, other films such as Black Mass delivers a more in depth-look of the mafia life style, but Legend opts for a direct personal view of the brothers and takes full advantage of the lead actor.Tom Hardy plays as both Ron and Reggie Kray, performed with a tweak of facial expression and mild change on make-up. Reggie is the more levelheaded one while Ron can be described as batcrap insane. They are both capable of violence and living a shared gangster life. The events are told by narration from Frances (Emily Browning), Reggies love interest and a silent witness to the horrible dealings.The movies strongest point is undoubtedly the lead, it is not often that this   one actor two roles   is used in cinema recently. Tom Hardy delivers everything expected from him, from the subtle or strong expression, change of speech and mannerism to intricate body language of different characters. Viewers know the twin scene is done by effect, yet they often look like two different persons interacting with each other.It dabbles in less criminal activities and more in private life, evident by using Frances a key point for developments even though she is mostly there as spectator, especially when mafia dealings are concerned. Emily Browning is a good addition, she handles her own well, but its not the level of outlandish on-screen presence like the Krays.While there is a definite involvement of crime thriller aspect, it doesnt portray the shady indulgent in its entirety. Its not the intricate inside view like that of American Hustle. There are few violent scenes, although the movie is not a noir gritty musing and some of the events could be done more thoroughly.Tom Hardy has done some interesting roles, but none arguably had this level of complexity. Legend further cemented his acting signature on the silver screen, it may not be an in-depth take of criminal enterprise, but he alone, or two of him, is enough to carry the movie.",

    "story": "A group of hunters pays for an elite hunt on a desert island - hunting for a man. Everything goes as planned until the hunters are the prey. Former policeman James Malone (Bruce Willis) is serving a life sentence for a crime he did not commit. He is given a chance to regain freedom if he survives a deadly game in which a group of hunters pays for the pleasure of hunting another human on a remote island. Malone accepts the rules, and when he arrives, he unleashes all hell by creating traps and waging a psychological war against the hunters. Loosely based on The Most Dangerous Game.I see people saying this is a remake of Surviving the Game or other similar movies but it was The Most Dangerous Game that was the original (1932) based on the book that all those movies are trying to copy.However this is probably the worst version. First, Bruce Willis is supposed to be some super tough guy yet at no point do we see anything that gives us the impression that hes a super tough guy. He does everything stupidly (the red jacket in the forest, walking around in plain site). We do not see him do anything super tough outside a couple quick things that really show us nothing. At no point is he believable as this super tough guy who shows them all up.The hunters are all morons who you do not believe have the slightest ability to hunt. They also do nothing that shows they have the skill that are implied. Its all a bunch of morons, all stupid and uninteresting. It was a pain to get through this awful movie.There is no way the whole island can be covered with cameras so there would definitely be spots someone could hide in. Its a giant island, if someone wanted to hide from the few stupid hunters with no actual hunting skill it would not be hard. And the girl that puts it all on who appears in holograms is dreadfully awful on top. I mean can you cast one part with someone believable?I try to give anything with Willis a try but seriously, he lost it a long time ago. This is one of his worst.",

Both Lead Actors Ayushmann and Jittu are amazing. Movies not great neither average too. A perfect Debut film is Jittu Bhaiya.I like the movie.

KulkarniSeriously what were the writers, directors, producers and actors thinking while making this movie. Its clearly unreal and in a bad way. So many loopholes that its become a sieve. Who gives visa to the entire family when one person gets a job in US? Which US state university will give admission to someone in 2 days for a MBA course? The family is shown struggling to make ends meet in India and as soon as they land in SFO they are shown to be staying in a multi-million dollar house! and these are just for the starters, too many bloopers all the way. Every time the lead actress gets a little makeover they show her entry in slow motion, I mean why. Moreover they show the antagonist entry (KSK) several times as well, like really.The movie undermines the relevance of a deadly disease like Alzheimers and shows it just as fillers and to add humor, thats super disgusting.Too much preaching about women power and their sacrifices.Corporate Job Interview:Interviewer: Why should we hire you?Interviewee: Because I am a female and females are superior and can bear the pain of child birth.This is the level of crap you are signing up for when you decide to watch it.Absolutely senseless and baseless movie. I would have gone for 2 stars but just because the movie was so horrible it gave me guilty pleasure of watching it, to see how can people throw their money making something so useless. So will go with 3 stars.",

    "story": "Novocherkassk, USSR, 1962. Lyudmila is a Party executive and devout communist who had fought in WWII for Stalins ideology. Certain that her work will create a communist society, the woman detests any anti-Soviet sentiment. During a strike at the local electromotive factory, Lyudmila witnesses a laborers piquet gunned down under orders from the government that seeks to cover up mass labor strikes in USSR. After the bloodbath, when survivors flee from the square, Lyudmila realizes her daughter has disappeared. A gaping rift opens in her worldview. Despite the blockade of the city, mass arrests, and the authorities attempts to cover up the massacre, Lyudmila searches for her daughter. We dont know how the search will end, but realize that the womans life wont ever be the same.The photography in Dear Comrades reminds very closely Konchalovskys 2016 film, Ray (Paradise): 4:3 aspect ratio, black and white, digital camera usage.Yet, the two films are strongly different, although they somehow feel intrinsically connected.Dear Comrades describes a workers strike occured in 1962 in Novocherkassk that was controversially smothered in blood, as seen from the point of view of a local party member (Yuliya Vyotskaya, who also the leading role in Paradise).It was impossible for me not to compare this film with Eisensteins 1925 masterpiece The Strike, which also features a revolution of the workers but against a zarist government. It is interesting to see how the tables have turned, and that same soviet government that threw over the zarist government acts exactly the same way. The film had also a bit of an Ida vibe, again minus the spiritual elements, and the ending sequence felt much like a classic hollywood dramas finale, intentionally so, which I found somewhat fitting to the slightly satyrical nature of the title.Let me be clear: this film is far from a satyre, it depicts with an almost Bressonian simplicity the dynamics of power and secrecy that were central to the functioning of the Soviet Union.Unlike the 2016 film, Dear Comrades has no spiritual dimension, it is strongly linked to the presentation of facts, as it should be, given the strong materialist/soviet tone of its story.Similarly to Paradise, though, it shows the brainwashing effects of the Stalinist era: the lead character has, until the end, a nostalgic attitude towards Stalin, whom she defends even when confronted with the gruesome crimes committed in his name.I hope that Dear Comrades gets distributed widely. Konchalovsky has been directing very outstanding films the whole decade, and this is yet another one of them.",

Specially Pankaj Tripathi, you want him to be more and more on the screen. Characters make you feel of the confusion and contradictions that they are in. The police officer is also a new actor discovered by the web platform.Story - Good story, couldve have been sharper. But in order to be close to reality, lack of sharpness can be ignored as often the reality is.Direction - Beautiful smooth direction amidst the chaos. Applaudable camera work too.",

    "story": "The A List is set in what appears to be an idyllic island summer camp, but where dark secrets will turn the holiday of lifetime into a twisted nightmare. Mia thinks shes all set for a summer of sun, romance and social dominance, but the late arrival of mysterious new girl Amber disrupts everything. Amber walks into the camp like she owns it; funny, confident, glamorous and effortlessly charming. Mia instantly hates her. Slowly, Mias former followers defect to Ambers side and Mia starts to suspect that theres much more at stake than a popularity contest...theres something in Ambers eyes. Something cold...something hungry...and when she locks her gaze to yours, you can feel it in your head, probing, cataloguing. And absorbing...Amber is not a normal girl, she has powers, they are growing and they are dangerous. The heightened tension and remote setting allow The A-List to explore universal teen concerns of friendship romance, loyalty and betrayal in an intense crucible of powerful and addictive drama.I dont do many reviews on here but after reading several of the posted reviews I felt like I should share my perspective.This show centers on a group of teenagers spending the summer at a summer camp on an island and how they deal with the mysterious events that take place as well as teenage politics and power plays.If you want adult programming you might be disappointed. If you want or require a big budget look you might be disappointed.If you want super witty and intellectual dialogue you might be disappointed.But if you are looking for a lightweight teenage mystery then this is pretty decent. It has a creepy supernatural vibe to it. Why is something you have to watch to find out. I personally enjoyed it, it took a few episodes to bond with the characters and get into the story but once that happened it became an enjoyable ride.",

The saving grace is Chris Pine. Even though he had a small role, he fit the role perfectly and was not so excessive. The color scheme is very bright and colorful, which makes the movie somewhat interesting, even with the subpar acting and plot.....Bad: The acting all around is either subar from the cast or over the top from Mindy Kaling and Zach Galifianakis that it comes out unnatural. Even with a good cast consisting of Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon, they did not add much to the movies benefit. Disney spent so much money on its adult characters that they forgot to hire good child actors/actresses for the child cast members are not even on par with some of the amazing child stars from Stranger Things, It, or Jungle Book.Overall: The movie is mainly geared towards elementary and middle school children with some adult aspects, yet the movie is childish and not up to Disneys standard. Disney should be embarrassed to have produced such a movie with big Hollywood names and have it bomb. The movie falls flat and lacks humor leading to a failure for Disney. Even though this movie is supposed to be a big statement towards diversity with a colored director helming a $100 million budget project, the movie does not do justice.2/5",

But unexpected problems arise as Alexander made a mistake that could change everything. ‚ÄîAnonymous User - EarthThe 17-year-old Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) receives a coded signal and his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) helps him to decipher the message. They find that Seans grandfather Alexander Anderson (Michael Caine) has found the mysterious island in the Pacific described by Julio Verne and two other writers in their novels.The stubborn Sean wants to travel to the coordinates and Hank decides to buy the tickets and travel with the teenager to a small island nearby the location. They rent an old helicopter owned by the locals Gabato (Luis Guzm√°n) and his teenage daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) and the group heads to the unknown spot. Along their journey, they cross a hurricane and crash in the island. They find a beautiful and dangerous place, surrounded by forests, volcanoes with lava of gold and menacing life forms. The meet also the old Alexander and Hank discovers that the island is sinking. Now their only chance to survive is to find the legendary Nautilus.   Journey 2: The Mysterious Island   is a movie with a trailer that is better than the film itself. The lame screenplay begins in a fast pace, with Hank and Sean guessing to quickly the message. The story is very weak and the film is supported by the special effects only. The spoiled Sean and the rude Alexander are detestable characters and Gabato is stupid and annoying and never funny as supposed to be. Hank is multi- skilled in codes, hydraulic and electric engineering, medicine, and music and diving. In the end,   Journey 2: The Mysterious Island   is a very disappointing adventure. My vote is four.Title (Brazil):   Viagem 2: A Ilha Misteriosa   (  Journey 2: The Mysterious Island  )",

It was entertaining. The story worked well. The acting was great. And the effects were really impressive. I watched it on a big screen in Bangkok and enjoyed the experience. The sound was equally impressive. I just cant understand why the really negative reviews abound. Some are cursing it for having foreign actors. Others about the political situation etc. And the poor director is even getting a caning. The story is about a legend. And it was wonderful to just sit back and let someone tell a story. I nearly didnt go because of all the bad reviews but I am glad I went and made up my own mind.Go and see it.",

Tapan prepares his own team for the upcoming Olympics.But during the partition team also gets divided along with the country. ‚Äîalex.mjacko@gmail.comGOLD REVIEW :One of the most awaited film of the year for me especially looking at Akshay Kumars script since now days and he was coming back after classic Padman so expectation from this one were high for obvious reasons. The trailer of the film was promising enough to build expectations among the people and now no hesitation to say that Gold lives up to the Expectations level, completely. I dont remember the last film which was released on Independence Day and totally deserved to be released on the day just because of its content and here comes Gold which I felt is completely deserving and probably the only deserving film for the Independence day release as far as this decade is concerned.Talking about the story Gold is a journey of Hockey Team Indias Struggle, Courage, Patients and Glorious Victory from pre independence period to Post independence period in typical filmy way. In acting Akshay Kumar has lived his character of a Bengali guy whose accent is completely amazing and his command over dialogue delivery is Superb. Mouni Roy as his wife looks Beautiful and mouths perfect Begali of that particular period. There is a big team of actors and everyone has done decent job which looks good on screen. Writing of the film its top notch, and is filled with plenty of Twists and cinematic moments. Dialogues are sober, quite encouraging and clap worthy. Cinematography is good because the locations of the film were set in old era, so the naturality should have remained intact and happily it remains intact. The Hockey Match sequences were shot in tactical way and have been supported by very well by VFX team & thrilling Background music.Done with all the positives of the film now coming towards the minuses. The biggest minus point of the film its music. Couple of songs are irritating and completely useless while the title song and one situational song are somewhat tolerable. Reema Kagti has done a very good job but I am personally very disappointed as I find the script was a Masterpiece material and Reema has failed to achieve that Masterpiece tag. Typical film-making and commercial vision has spoiled the Classic content at some level which doesnt let this film end up on a classic note. Come on, you dont need every scene to be Filmy and twisty, sometimes you can just go with the flow. But that doesnt mean it is a bad film, it is very good one indeed. Though, it could have been a Classic. Two patriotic films I remember with almost no minuses at all are Chak De India and Dangal Where The Masterpiece writing was molded into classic cinematic gem and the credit definitely goes to the directors and their vision which seems lacking in the case of Gold. One of the most important thing about those two Films was that these two classics didnt have any useless love making scenes and Gold has couple of loo-breaks in that form.In final talk, I would say Gold is the most deserving Independence Day release of this decade because of Shivering last 30 Minutes portion and despite not being a classic this one is still a must watch if you want to see some patriotic Hysteria this Independence Day. This one is a winner All The Way... Critically as well as Commercially. This one was a 9/10* material but Reema Kagti has made out a 7/10* film while the great run of Akki continues....",

When their newborn son mysteriously vanishes and their crops fail, the family begins to turn on one another. The Witch is a chilling portrait of a family unraveling within their own sins, leaving them prey for an inconceivable evil.I feel like I cant come up with the right words to describe this incredible movie, but Ill try. The lingering atmosphere is done incredibly well from the beginning, helped along by a combination of a tense score and the use of extended periods of silence. The acting is bang-on and you dont know when or how it is going to end. The movie doesnt have twists exactly, but the way it is written keeps you guessing constantly. And I personally loved the ending. Though the potential is there to use a more standard approach, The Witch however opts to go down a more subtle avenue, leading to the true nature of religious persecution that is on full display here. Additionally, elements of the story have been taken from historical documents, adding another layer of grimness. The supernatural elements are obviously up for discussion, but that these tales were written centuries ago somehow adds more to this disturbing film.The film is set in 1630, in New England, America. A Puritan family is banished from town for their beliefs (or it at least seems this way, perhaps based on real events). They are forced to move to a farm that feels like it is on the edge of the world, as from the opening the woods that line the farm are presented in ominous fashion, almost creating a character that could serve as the scariest element of the film. What exactly goes on in there? Why cant the children venture inside? Suddenly, without warning, tragedy strikes. The family clings to their faith to prevent them from starving as their crops die; with nothing they can do to prevent it.The period is an appropriate choice given how humans treated each other centuries ago, and an ideal setting for a horror tale. Some conversations require a little more attention, as the characters speak in ye olde English which takes a little getting used to, but it adds another layer of mystery as the family is struck by more inexplicable hardships, causing them to become wary of each other, which in turn leaves them in a increasingly vulnerable state. I cant say I is scared, but I do know that I is gripping the armrests pretty hard for most of the film. Hell, they manage to make a scene where a man is hunting a rabbit seem tense and creepy! Additionally, this is not for inattentive viewers; I could see clock-watching all around me. The incredible camera-work almost reminds me of Paul Thomas Anderson in There Will Be Blood, with many long takes, often slowly panning or zooming in. There is also a focus on facial close-ups reminiscent of Bergman, all of which is a feast to watch on an IMAX screen. The score matches this camera-work almost to perfection, while there is often a lengthy silence between dialogue to contrast the tense music. It also must be mentioned that the child actors really shine, out-doing their older counterparts.This really is my sort of horror film. No jump-scares, convincing acting and a focus on a dark, foreboding atmosphere rather than the grotesque and bloody. This is another of those films I would label as a psychological thriller, as the supernatural horrors are kept almost completely out of view as we witness the downfall of a family who are all affected, turning on each other as their faith is truly tested.This film couldnt have catered to my interests more; I cant recommend it to everybody, but if you go in with no preconceived notions youll be in for a tasty, if not nasty surprise. The suspense is almost unparalleled among recent films, and the horror genre conventions are cleverly subverted to deliver a film that is better than It Follows while being a completely different film. In addition to all this, there is much to take in thematically if you are so inclined¬Ö Hell, Id love to see this again to do just that.www.epilepticmoondancer.net",

The music score is whimsical and lively.The Secret Life of Pets is also very wittily and often hilariously scripted, some of the best lines coming from Snowball, and there are some neat references to Grease, Saturday Night Fever and Some Like it Hot. As said, much of the story is charming with enough of the entertainment factor.Lastly the voice acting is pretty terrific, Kevin Hart, Albert Brooks and Steve Coogan coming off best.Overall, there is much to enjoy in The Secret Life of Pets, though it is more a good film than a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me Game of Thrones is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me Game of Thrones is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about Game of Thrones without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isnt a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.Whenever theres a set-piece or more action-oriented scene theres always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. Theyre not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. Game of Thrones has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesnt like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.Game of Thrones cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic.

While he forces each to atone for their sins, he must also face what meting out vengeance will do to his immortal soul. Meanwhile, hes not the only one looking to settle old scores: hired by the man responsible for the events which led him to prison, an eccentric contract killer follows his every move. Scenes of them crossing paths, sometimes violently, are interspersed with the assassins self-realizations of how to deal with struggles within his own life. As if old enemies and hired guns arent enough, a young female detective begrudgingly works alongside a veteran investigator looking to simply survive his last two weeks on the force before retirement, as they seek out the brazen ex-con who has been blazing a path of gasoline-powered destruction in his vintage Chevelle. ‚ÄîahmetkozanThis was the first movie our family went to in a long time, and it was so worth it! My boys said it was excellent.The plot was simple enough, bad guy wants revenge for the murder of a loved one. In all honesty, it didnt seem to need a wide range of acting from Dwayne Johnson (aka, The Rock). I should rephrase that; it wasnt so much the dialog, but his mannerisms and facial expressions that said it all!The movie wasnt just about revenge, it also looked into how he got to be the way he was... the way he was treated growing up. It talked about forgiveness & redemption. I say its about time The Rock (I will always know him as that!) got back to what he does best, Action/Adventure. Like The Rundown he did with Sean Scott. All in All, I would give this movie a B++",

    "story": "A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond (Daniel Craig) on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra (Monica Belluci), the beautiful and forbidden widow of an infamous criminal. Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organisation known as S.P.E.C.T.R.E. Meanwhile, back in London, Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott), the new head of the Centre of National Security, questions Bonds actions and challenges the relevance of MI6, led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond covertly enlists Miss Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) to help him seek out Dr. Madeleine Swann (L√©a Seydoux), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), who may hold the clue to untangling the web of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. As the daughter of the assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of S.P.E.C.T.R.E., he learns a chilling connection between him and the enemy he seeks.Reviewers notes humbly submitted: 1. This reviewer not only watched all the Sean Connery movies in theatres but read all the novels too. Does that date me? 2. The Biography Channel Special on Ian Fleming portrayed him as an ageing indolent frat boy who wrote his novels using a typewriter on the beach using the two finger method while cavorting. Hard to believe such innocent beginnings led to a franchise that just will not die.3. Speaking of franchises, Hollywood is running out. Which is why Stallone was able to raise the cash to turn his C-rated Expendables series into an A level franchise. And why Fast and Furious -- which started out as a drama script not a special effects gimmick -- is the new Mission Impossible. So, against this backdrop, if you are going to do Bond, you do it big. At least that is what the producers thought. At 2 and half hours, however, the audience starts to wonder if .. maybe ... less is more? 4. Craig is good. Probably the best Bond since Sean. If only the writers and producers could support him the way he deserves.5. The first reboot with Craig was the best, remains the best. The second was horrid. The bizarre entry which took place in his childhood home in the English countryside -- the one where a classic car was gratuitously machine-gunned for no obvious reason -- almost killed the franchise completely. This entry -- essentially a mishmash of Dr. No and the old Mannix TV show with a dollop of modern political correctness thrown in -- is OK, but will never make it to brilliant.6. Times change, years pass. The gold standard for this sort of movie is the Damon/Bourne series, even more ironic because (so far) that franchise remains in limbo. The first reboot here was a close competitor. So far, no other instalment in this series has even come close.",

The idea that it is based on a true story is intriguing, but 100% on Rotten Tomatoes??? Give me a break.Is Netflix and Rotten Tomatoes resorting to fake advertising? It really distracted from the film itself, because it was watchable and creepy but I give it a generous 7 star just for the actress and creepy nun.Obviously film reviewing it back to PAYOLA and somehow related to politics.",

    "story": "In sun-kissed Emerald Bay, the vigorous Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon and Baywatch, his elite team of hand-picked and perfectly tanned lifeguards, protect the bay, keeping both sunbathers and beach lovers safe. However, this summer, two new eager trainees will join the demanding life-saving program, as well as an insubordinate former Olympic swimmer, who are all called to prove their worth on the lifeguard towers just on time when a new synthetic street drug begins to infest the Emerald Bay: the flakka. Without a doubt, this calls for some serious undercover teamwork action, as the badgeless heroes in spandex comb the beach for shady newcomers and nefarious entrepreneurs with hidden agendas of their own. Can Mitchs band save the bay? ‚ÄîNick RiganasIts a warm, beautiful day on the beach. The pristine waves crash gently against the sand as the sun-kissed folk of Southern Florida come out to play. Lifeguard Post 1 stands like a sentinel - its windows permanently cocked forward towards the horizon. Theres a change in the wind. A wind surfer looses control of his sail and is catapulted upward towards the sky before plummeting, head first into a coral reef. Hes knocked unconscious...all seems lost. Then Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) appears on the scene.What results is a valiant rescue that inexplicably involves slow-motion running, Dwayne The Rock Johnson flexing his pectorals underwater, fireworks and dolphins for some reason. The movie could have stopped right there as by that point we got the best version of what could have been the cinematic version of a far-fetched TV show. Unfortunately the first fifteen minutes arent so much a harbinger of the hilarity to come but rather a visual metaphor for the movies inflated sense of self.The film energetically sets up its main characters with all-too-brief introductions on tryout day. We immediately endear ourselves veterans Stephanie (Hadera), C.J. (Rohrbach) and Mitch as they judge incoming trainees the tough and brainy Summer (Daddario), the dorky Ronnie (Bass) and disgraced former Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (Efron) whose ego Mitch sees as a liability. Much of the films prouder moments are spent with The Rock and Efron doing what they do best; The Rock deflating Brodys ego with real-deal charisma and action hero one-liners - Efron playing the dim-witted, put-upon jock who deserves everything he has coming to him because he was in High School Musical (2006).But just when you think everything will turn out for this movie, the narrative drastically shifts to a crime story that stops the movies momentum cold. The narrative thrust involves the new owner of the beachs fancy yacht club (Chopra) and her suspicious connection to a new designer drug called Flaka. The rest of the movie doesnt so much spend time exploring that connection or its implications (Chopra compares herself favorably to a Bond villain pretty much from the get go) but instead it lays every aspect of the conspiracy out on the table and waits for the lifeguards to connect the dots.This ploy not only doesnt work but it basically splits Baywatch into two completely unsatisfying pieces. The first piece brings a diversity of comic set-pieces which on their own, probably couldnt make a good sketch on Key and Peele (2012-2015). They lack a depth of character requiring one or two of them to be more gullible, less resourceful or otherwise dumber than what was previously established.The other half of the movie plants its flag firmly on The Rocks ability to recap what we already know while Priyanka Chopra chews unhelpfully on the scenery until the timer runs out. All throughout the film drops hints that you should care about this or that - an insert shot of a watch brings more pause than a fiery boat rescue. Yet because nothing new is ever revealed, the films call for attention becomes soporifically annoying.The overall tone of the film is also aggressively reductive, treating the, in retrospect quaint misogyny of the original series with an uncomfortable amount of contrarian glee. Every time one of the girls of Baywatch justifiably call out the boys for being pervs, the payoff by the end of the film amounts to nothing more than quid pro quo ribbing or worse - they end up with the dude at the end. If Baywatch had just treated the subject as window-dressing, I might have been inclined to let it go (after all trash TV is trash TV). Unfortunately the movie stops just short of waving its d**k in the air while saying you think were being sexist, f**k you bruh! Thus I think its worth a brief mention.Baywatch has all the necessary ingredients to make a pretty satisfying comedic soup. Unfortunately apart from The Rock and Efron standing out as the films sole saving graces, everything else is squandered on a useless story, oblivious editing and a unifying tone thats unnecessarily combative. Unless youre the type of person who truly believes Kelly Rohrbachs slo-mo runs along the beach are enough to maintain your attention, I suggest skipping out on this aggressively unfunny movie.On a related note: Stop with the dorky guy gets the hot girl for doing nothing clich√©. Its been done a hundred times before, youre bringing nothing new to the table and its come to the point where if you do it at all it just feels icky. The Sam Witwickys of the the world should have to, you know, work for it now.",

If you liked that one you will like this. It is very much just more of the same. If it aint broke, you know.A couple new faces, one of them I really liked seeing. Wont say who it was, but if youre older than 20, chances are good you like the person.The action is like last time, its entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good. The Rock has some, lets call them punching scenes, which I liked. Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.They once again have fun with the fact that the characters   in game   represent characters in the movies   real life  . And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think hes taking some serious acting classes, hes getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.I didnt feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though. Felt more like just an adventure, than an adventure videogame. They could have hammered home a little better. So yeah, I was entertained, but its pretty shallow and wont stick with me like, say, the origianl Jumanji. (I watched that as a kid, and it was kind of revolutionary, so of course it stuck) Nice family flick.",

    "story": "In New York, unemployed and divorced Larry Daley is a complete loser. His son Nick is very disappointed with his father who is going to be evicted. Larry accepts the job of night watchman in the Museum of Natural History and takes the place of three old security guards that have just retired in order to raise some money and pay his bills. On his first shift, Larry soon realizes that everything at the museum is not as it seems as the statues begin to come to life after the sun sets. The Museum transforms into complete chaos with the inexperienced Larry in charge as he learns that an old Egyptian stone that came to the Museum in 1950 brings these statues to life until dawn. When Larry brings his son to spend a night with him, the three old guards break into the Museum to try to steal the magical stone. Larry organizes all the historic characters to help him stop the criminals and save the museum. ‚ÄîClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilSlightly overlong - and lacking the perhaps obligatory love interest - this is as good a film as any parent will be able to excite their kids with this holiday period - well certainly in the UK. The film has huge plot holes and probably hundreds of continuity errors but rampaging dinosaurs, goodish CGI and another athletic comic turn from Ben Stiller, together with the gorgeous Carla Gugino make this near perfect Xmas cinematic fair.The Museum of Natural History is suffering a downturn in visitor numbers and has to make cutbacks by way of night security men. Step up Larry Daly (Stiller) in an attempt to retain his home and convince ex wife that he is a role model for their impressionable son. The films premise that the various waxwork and skeleton inhabitants come to life at night due to the presence of a magical Egyptian golden tablet placed 50 years before is, of course, to suspend disbelief beyond anything else youll be expected to this year - but anyone at a loss for an excuse to get the kids out of the house over the Christmas period could do a lot worse than spend just under a couple of hours at the multiplex to see what is a cross between Jumanji and the Indian in the Cupboard.",

Its A Winner!2 States Synopsis: A young couples plan to get hitched, gets crushed when their racial parents disapprove of their marriage. 2 States has an amazing first-hour & the lead-stars, Arjun & Alia, share an infectious chemistry on-screen. The Tamil-Punjabi conflict does get a bit boring, especially in the middle of the second-hour, but a heart-warming culmination, does the trick. Its not a perfect film, but its most certainly, enjoyable! The Screenplay hits the right notes, at most parts. Barring a few dull sequences post-interval, the film is consistently engaging & smooth. Abhishek Varman makes a terrific debut as a Director. He has handled the entire film, remarkably. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is well-done. Art & Costume Design, are fair. Music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is fantastic. Performance-Wise: Arjun & Alia are the life of the show. They enact the love-struck protagonists with pure charm. Their on-screen chemistry, as mentioned before, is infectious. Amrita Singh is delightfully rude, while Shiv Kumar Subramaniam & Revathy are wonderfully restrained. Ronit Roy stands out. Hes excellent, yet again! Achint Kaur is lovely in a brief role.On the whole, 2 States clicks big time. Strongly Reccomeded!",

Will Smith, as a low-key   Ben Thomas   will keep you guessing. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and its a shocker....but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. Until then, Smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. You know he has a good reason for doing it, but its never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end.All of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins (  Emily Posa  ) might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....but dont because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together.This is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho Will Smith film. In fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of Smith throughout this story. It almost doesnt even look like him in a number of shots. He looks like hes lost weight and is sick. Smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness.Like a good movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits.",

She was so interesting before and now she is just as boring as all of the other characters. Most boring of all is Alex. She was edgy in seasons 1 and 2 and now she is just annoying - not interesting at all.

    "story": "Dom and the crew must take on an international terrorist who turns out to be Dom and Mias estranged brother.In the 20 years of its existence, The Fast & the Furious franchise has upgraded itself several times over the years. What started as a story about illegal street racing transitioned to heist thrillers with Fast Five and with every next sequel inflating the action set pieces & discarding physics, the series now enjoys the same status as comic-book blockbusters, glued together by its sermons about family. F9 continues this new tradition by taking things to preposterous heights and is another dumb entry in the saga.Directed by Justin Lin (Fast Five & Star Trek Beyond), this ninth instalment simply looks at all the ridiculous premise & over-the-top action the last few instalments employed and just tries to take the next big leap. Logic & gravity left the saga a long time back so viewers expecting any of it now are only kidding themselves. Brainless entertainment can be fun when its done right but its all executed so terribly here that along with common sense goes its sense of joy. The action & drama just feels bland, soulless & uninspiring.If you thought that Dom & his so-called family taking on planes, trains, tanks & submarine in the previous chapters was a tad too much then you will be amused by the places this sequel ventures to. And yet, none of it feels even remotely surprising. Its full of setups, twists & dull action that never for once stimulate the senses and are predictable from afar. Performances dont deserve a mention just like the schlocky writing on display here. Its 143 mins runtime is strongly felt and even its attempts at humour fall flat this time around.Overall, F9 is as forgettable as it is formulaic and isnt even enjoyable for the most part. The ridiculous action sequences dialled to extremity is just hollow from within, and fall way short of delivering the desired payoff. From beginning to end, it is an absolute chore to sit through. Despite the glaring shortcomings, fans of the saga may still manage to scavenge something out of this big-budget garbage. A lifeless & lacklustre piece of blockbuster filmmaking, F9 is one of the weakest additions to The Fast Saga and is no less than an utter disappointment.",

At 86 years old, he drives to the office every morning to manage Berkshire Hathaway, the fifth largest public company in the world. But more surprising than his humble lifestyle is his moral core. The same principles of decency and integrity that helped him pile up a fortune led him to give it all away in the largest philanthropic donation in history. Becoming Warren Buffett chronicles the evolution of a boy from Nebraska who became one of the most respected men in the world, and the heroes who helped guide him along the way. By allowing access to his life and never-before-released home videos, Buffett offers a glimpse into his unique mind to help us understand what is truly important when money no longer has meaning.The life story of Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and one of the wealthiest people in the world. Buffett made his fortune through canny, rational investment and is probably the greatest, most successful investor of all time. This documentary traces his history, from childhood to the present day and interviews not only himself, but many of his close family and business associates.Very well made drama on a man with an incredible ability for investment and business management. Well researched, with some rare footage of Buffett. Interviewees are all relevant, and not simply Buffett fans singing his praises. The family interviews also show his personal side, including his flaws (many of which is happy to admit himself).The documentary also covers his philanthropic deeds, the area that will ensure Buffetts legacy.",

    "story": "1400 B.C., a tormented soul walked the Earth that was neither man nor god. Hercules (Dwayne The Rock Johnson) was the powerful son of the god King Zeus. For this, he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labors, and the death of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years, he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting, and the presence of death. These men and women never question where they go to fight, or why, or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now, the King of Thrace, Lord Cotys (Sir John Hurt) has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen, when they must train an army to become as ruthless and bloodthirsty as their reputation has become. ‚ÄîahmetkozanThis film was a real surprise to me. I was expecting something that was a cross between Kevin Sorbos TV show and Wrath of the Titans. But the producers chose a completely different direction for this re-telling. Aside from the shorts at the beginning we see no monsters. Nor do we see beautiful gods and goddesses. Hercules greatest enemy in this story is the very real (and human) threat of betrayal and treachery. And rather than a one man- show, we see Hercules aided by a band of loyal friends who are every bit as skilled as the demigod. The film raises the question what is more important: what others believe of you or what you believe about yourself? The film has a bevy of great actors including John Hurt, Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell and I think Dwayne Johnson is perfect for the main role.",

    "story": "After failing to get into the police academy, Chris Potamitis (Liam Hemsworth), settles for a security guard job with the EMPIRE STATE Armored Truck Company. Chris makes the mistake of mentioning the companys lax security to his best friend, Eddie (Michael Angarano), and is soon unwittingly drawn into an elaborate scheme to rob the abundant amounts of cash being stored there - resulting in the largest cash heist in U.S. History. As the stakes continue to rise, Chris and Eddie must outwit Detective James Ransone (Dwayne Johnson), an NYPD veteran who is hot on their trail, as well as the local crime lords that want to know who pulled off a job on their turf, or suffer the consequences. ‚ÄîLionsgateIts been reported that over 9 million dollars were taken in last nights heist.Empire State surprisingly begins with a lot of promise. The beginning of the film sets the right mood and tone with an incredible 80s vibe bringing out some nostalgic memories. It had the right look and some interesting characters and the story is based on true events of one of the largest heists in American history. I thought I was going to enjoy this criminal thriller, but about half hour into the movie everything began to go downhill. Dwayne Johnson and Emma Roberts who were on the cover of the film are only supporting characters who get very little screen time. You begin to see characters come in and out of the story without any real purpose (Nikki Reed barely has a meaningless cameo in this). The true lead actors in Empire State are Liam Hemsworth and Michael Angarano, and their characters are portrayed in such a light that we are supposed to sympathize with these guys, but that never happens. Director, Dito Montiel (whose previous work include Fighting and The Son of No One both starring Channing Tatum), never manages to engage the audience with the film and its disappointing because he had some talented actors and a great premise to work with. Overall the ending is probably the weakest and laziest part of the film after having a somewhat interesting buildup. The script was written by Emmy Award winning writer, Adam Mazer (You Dont Know Jack), and this is probably his weakest film. Montiel hasnt had much success in his films, but somehow he always manages to work with a high profile cast; if he doesnt do something different he is going to have a short career as a director. The film is based on a true story about a heist that took place at Empire State armored truck company. Chris Potamitis (Liam Hemsworth) is a young kid who dreams of becoming a cop in order to help his family out. Unfortunately due to an incident that took place a few years ago with his best friend, Eddie (Michael Angarano), he is rejected by the Police Academy and is denied the test. Chris has to settle for working as a security guard at an armored truck company which doesnt pay much. To make matters worse, his partner is killed at a heist and the company doesnt pay the insurance for his family. Upset by this, Chris decides to steal a small amount of money from the company in order to help them out. He tells his friend Eddie about this and Eddie thinks its a good idea to steal the millions of dollars that are stacked at this place with little security. Along with some other small time criminals, they plan to take it all, but they have to be careful because NYPD, James Ronsone (Dwayne Johnson) is hot on their trail. They will also have to watch out for the big mafia criminals who wouldnt appreciate a heist taking place in their area without their knowledge. Stealing the money might not be such an easy task as Eddie and Chris believe it to be. Emma Roberts, Jerry Ferrara, Chris Diamantopoulos, and Michael Rispoli all play very small roles in this film. This is Dwight Johnsons fifth film of 2013 but this is by far his smallest and most forgettable role. Liam Hemsworth doesnt have what it takes to be a lead and so it was very hard to care for these characters and what was going on. The premise was promising, but somehow they couldnt create a decent criminal thriller that would engage the audience. It is a shame because this story could have been told so much better and some of the actors could have been used better. Overall I enjoyed the 80s vibe and the nostalgic feeling the first 30 minutes gave me reminding me of all the films I watched as a kid during that time. The last hour is so messy that it just ruined everything. The characters are completely one dimensional and cardboard copies and the film is completely predictable.",

The mismatched duo must look past their differences when they take on a high-profile investigation of shady capitalist David Ershon and attempt to fill the shoes of the notoriously reckless officers they idolize. ‚ÄîThe Massie TwinsWill Ferrell is back since the disappointing Land of the Lost! Who knew Mark Wahlberg could be genuinely hilarious? The Other Guys is the latest comedy to poke fun at the buddy cop genre, but this one is one of the best because the actors and director knew what they were doing.Ferrell and Wahlberg have terrific chemistry and both of them have perfect comedic timing. But lets not forget the other supporting actors (too many to list here), as all of them have some memorable and quotable lines.The jokes weave through slapstick and crude territory, while not being overly vulgar and overdone. The story is actually pretty engaging, as it is a genuine cop mystery at its core, but it is used as a vehicle for all the jokes to come in. And the jokes kept coming and had the entire audience laughing as well, this one the loudest compared to the previous Steve Carell entries Date Night and Dinner For Schmucks. Sorry Steve, this year Will and Mark stole the audience.Having said that, the production design, cinematography, editing, stunts/special effects are good, and the direction by Adam McKay is lighthearted and brisk. McKay is seriously becoming a big name in comedy film directors, and here is another memorable feather in his cap.Overall, if you are in need of a laugh, see this movie A.S.A.P. This one is one of the funniest movies in years, and thats being honest.Overall rating: 73/10",

Muzaffarnagar is ruled by two gangs, Mohammad Shaukeen Khan and the Dedha brothers who had systematically divided the land into two parts . With no witnesses willing to testify and the police seemingly fearful of wanting to apprehend the known culprits, Naveen charts out his three-pronged strategy. First, the Police force needs to start believing in themselves, second, have the locals rekindle their faith in the Police and third, let it be known to the gangsters that Naveen Sikhera wouldnt bow down till he makes Muzaffarnagar the safest district of the heartland. He includes his Meerut team in his operation, infiltrates his moles into the gangs, begins mobile surveillance, battles the media and politicians, wins the respect of both the locals and his very own Police force with his drive to clean the system. Taking the reins in his hands, Sikhera starts cleansing the city and undertakes numerous encounters leading to the destruction of the Shaukeen gang and making in-roads into the operations of the Dedha gang. This is the story of a man who left a cushy life and soon became one of the most feared and loved officers but with a price to pay, but then again every revolution is built on sacrifices and this one unfortunately had its unfair share.10 episode action packed series with plot twist at every possible point. A little more character development would have been useful but this is a good effort, good stuff no doubt.",

I wont intentionally watch it, but every time I come across it on tv I stick to the channel. I wont call it one of the best movies ever made, maybe not even in the genre, it does have its flaws but its the type of movie that I call breath of fresh air, it brings a whole new concept to to the movie industry thats also well-thought out and I love to see it. Im pretty saddened that even after all these years I havent heard of any serious talk of sequels come to fruition, I had hoped itd be a franchise-starter and that such a lovely concept wont die with just this one-off film. It deserved to be a trilogy at the least to help understand how the world came to be and add some character depth and development. Regardless Im glad I still got to see it. Disappointing it didnt capture audiences the as much as the creators expected.",

Dhoni had a burden of expectations on it - not just because it is based on Indias most beloved captain but also it had Neeraj Pandey as Director. The movie is well made but runs into too much of unnecessary stuff, especially in the second half. It is pretty much left on its own in the later part. Sushant Singh Rajput is bloody impressive with his uncanny resemblance to MSD, not just in terms of looks but also the expressions. Story (7/10): The movie focused really well on the life of MSD before he became a household name. It focused a lot on the challenges, small town boys had been facing to get an entry into Indian cricket team about 10 years back when metro boys, especially Delhi and Mumbai, had a great influence on the team composition. What I also loved was the portrayal of Dhonis work ethic - be it the scene of Yuvraj Singh or the booze. The first half of the story shows the tremendous amount of research done on the build up of MSD and the people involved in getting him into the Indian cricket team. Unfortunately, the story is left orphaned once it crosses that chapter. Too much focus on his love life was not just unnecessary but also slowed down the movie tremendously. I would have loved to see some focus on what exactly made him CAPTAIN COOL and at least some bits of behind the scenes portrayal of what happened in the dressing room in the 2011 WC Final. But the story just skips through that, which is a big let down. Acting (10/10): Sushant Singh Rajput did a great job. He had a challenging role and his hard work showed in the way he projected MSD, in terms of looks as well as expressions. This would definitely go in as one of his best performances, arguably better than Byomkesh Bakshi. What I loved was the effort and the screen presence by the supporting cast - especially MSDs friend circle and also his school coach, played by Rajesh Sharma. The last time I saw such a level of presence by supporting cast was, perhaps, in Tanu Weds Manu series.Direction (6/10): This was definitely below par performance of Neeraj Pandey, considering his reputation. While a lot of research and meticulousness went into the first half of the movie, it was equally misdirected and vague in the second half. The story pretty much ended at the point when MSD makes it into the Indian cricket team. I felt Neeraj Pandey tends to play safe and is compelled to add romance element irrespective of the movie genre, just like he did in Baby and Special 26 where, again, it wasnt required at all. And this is what takes down this movie. While three hours is pretty much expected in biopic movies, he didnt utilize it to the best. Overall (7/10): It lives up to its tagline - The Untold Story - with some great research on the life of MSD in his early years but the movie just becomes directionless in the second half. But still, a good movie to watch, at least half of it.",

The BGM was quite loud whereas most songs in the movie failed to impress.The climax was too predictable after the first half.The direction was pretty ordinary ,mixing up comedy and serious scenes.The story sometimes went out of logic but the stunts were really awesome and pulsating.The stunts were of high class even though it was a little exaggerated. Overall the movie is a good entertainer for the its stunts and comedies but only a one time watch for the story.",

Meanwhile, his parents arrange a marriage for him but he rejects the girl without meeting her. The twist is that the alliance is with none other than Savitri. What happens next forms the rest of the story.Savitri (Nanditha) was born during a wedding, and that shapes her life in that all she wants groiwng up is to be a bride. When her family finally set up a wedding for her, she is overjoyed, and takes a trip to ask a blessing for her marriage. On that trip, Savitri meets Rishi (Nara Rohit), who falls in love with her instantly, shaking up both of their marriage plans.This cute Telagu romance is laugh-out-loud funny in places, reminding me of a 1940s Hollywood screwball comedy. Unfortunately, as a lot of the humor was spoken in quick deliveries, it was hard to keep up while reading subtitles. In addition, there was a subplot that didnt make complete sense, nor particularly add to the plot. Rohit was excellent, easily pulling the audience to his side, and his action scenes were great fun. Nandithas part was such that the viewer has to warm to her, and she played it well. The pair had good chemistry together. Overall, though silly in parts, it was an enjoyable film.",

    "story": "In the 1910s, Srinivasa Ramanujan is a man of boundless intelligence that even the abject poverty of his home in Madras, India, cannot crush. Eventually, his stellar intelligence in mathematics and his boundless confidence in both attract the attention of the noted British mathematics professor, G.H. Hardy, who invites him to further develop his computations at Trinity College at Cambridge. Forced to leave his young wife, Janaki, behind, Ramanujan finds himself in a land where both his largely intuitive mathematical theories and his cultural values run headlong into both the stringent academic requirements of his school and mentor and the prejudiced realities of a Britain heading into World War One. Facing this with a family back home determined to keep him from his wife and his own declining health, Ramanujan joins with Hardy in a mutual struggle that would define Ramanujan as one of Indias greatest modern scholars who broke more than one barrier in his worlds. ‚ÄîKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)Just saw this film at the SF Film Festival. I thought it was excellent. Why? It combines various levels of entertainment: the intellectual mathematics involved and the realities of academic competition; the historical and cultural conflicts between Indian and English traditions, attitudes, biases, and beliefs; the emotional love/friendship between men, between men and women, and between children and parents; and inhumanity towards other humans: warmongers vs. pacifists, religious vs. non-religious, individuals vs. groups, misunderstandings and lack of emotional intelligence in so many ways. I comprehended very little of the mathematics involved but that did not matter and did not change my overall appreciation for the story and all the levels involved. Kudos to all who created this film. The writing, the acting, the cinematography, the direction, all excellent...",

When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely, and certainly unwanted, visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remys passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down. ‚ÄîOrangeI just saw Ratatouille tonight.Its a first class movie. Several thoughts come to mind...-The character performances are so good, I think theres no sort of movie they couldnt make. Ive heard Pixars John Carter of Mars is going to be live action? No! I want them to do it all animated.-Cars definitely _was_ a lower-value softball they threw to finish out that original Disney-gets-half-of-everything-plus-sequel-rights contract they were in at the time. I remember all the clucking last summer about how Pixar had lost its way.-There were a few moments when they seemed to lose that stylized reality they had established and things looked merely real.-There was one scene in the latter part of the film where I thought I cant believe they are doing this tired movie clich√© but they pulled out of it at the last second and made it something new.-The 2D-ish end credits were great. Stick it out to the very end to see the mo-cap disclaimer!-With this, Brad Bird is certainly one of the animation gods now.",

And the actors have earned my applause too.This film is one of the best Crime/Thrillers I have watched in a recent times.

Also, he imparts an ancient-medieval look to the film in the parts where it is necessary be it through sepia-tint, patina, cobwebs, etc which lends a certain authenticity.However, in Pakistan, he has the locals talking in Telugu which seemed out of place and inaccurate.Yeleti has been able to get the best out of his technicians be it his writing team, cinematographer Shamdat, editor Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao, music director Sri or art director Ramakrishna. Shamdats camera is top-notch.He shoots the action sequences and the treasure hunt, especially towards the climax excellently.Ramakrishnas art work, especially the set used for the climax, is commendable. Sris background score was apt for this kind of a film. Kotagiri Venkateswara Raos editing was fine too.Gopichand carried the film ably on his shoulders showing the necessary emotions.

His thoughts and later circumstances move him to adopt a nondescript village and develop it against various odds. A wealthy entrepreneur (Jagapathi Babu) is a worried lot owing to his sons (Mahesh Babu) indifferent and aloof attitude. He wishes his son to acquire and continue the monumental business empire that he built over his lifetime. But, the latter does not agree to it, stating that he wishes to acquire respect first. His thoughts lie elsewhere. He meets a girl (Shruthi Haasan) and they soon fall in love owing to the similarity in their thoughts. However, when she gets to know his identity, she simply ignores him. When confronted, she chides him that he is too rich and does not even know the place of his birth. She is later revealed to be the daughter of a benevolent village head (Dr Rajendra Prasad). Incidentally that is the same village. Later, the hero visits and adopts the village, financing and taking active part in construction of a school, roads etc. This brings him an inevitable clash with a selfish union minister and his brother, who grip the village in a reign of terror and fear. How the hero convinces his father and embarks on a difficult path forms thus, the crux of the story. ‚ÄîMass_SonuTollywood was suffering from routine formula storys.Writers were too afraid and directors were not willing to take any risk with new formulas.As a result we get to eat same stuff cooked in new bowl every Friday.But this Friday is different with srimanthudu.This movie deals with strong content which we dont usually get.That strong content is expressed with strong emotions with extraordinary actors.No forced comedy,No forced punch dialouges,No forced fights.Srimanthudu is very neat and i mean it in every different way.Koratala siva has mastered the village nativity and we should really thank him for what he was trying to do with srimanthudu.What words were left to describe mahesh babu.He is defeating himself in acting with every movie.Shruthi hassan was beautiful and she did her job very well.Music was soul of the movie.Srimanthudu song was played as background song in some scenes and every time this song is played,it was right on time.Jaago song was highlight of the movie.it changes the momentum of the movie and mahesh babus attitude in this song was like never seen before.Every body did beat in their job and result was srimanthudu.Plz dont miss this,because this type of movies,presented in every perfect way are rare in tollywood.",

Now he is Pulimurugan, but he has to face the tigers as well as the dangerous humans, as he is forced to move out of forest. This forms the rest of the story. ‚ÄîAkash M SWithout doubt,Pulimurugan was the most anticipated Malayalam movie this year that took two years in production taking its budget to a whooping 25 Crore making it the most expensive Mollywood film as per the makers.To my surprise,I was welcomed by the huge full-sheet paper ad this morning,first of its kind as far as Mollywood is concerned.Height of faith in ones creation??Ahh! Maybe.The movie started of with some stellar frames of the lush green forests,presenting the childhood back-story of Lalettan which was portrayed brilliantly by one debutant child artist,a promising prodigy to lookout for in future.Vysakh proved his mettle once again by presenting a normal formulaic storyline by Udayakrishna thats lifted up a level by the convincing narration and good screen presence of Mohanlal .The first half was really impressive with never-before seen breathtaking action sequences choreographed by Peter Hein,well-presented VFX,lovable performance by Mohanlal and hilarious counters shared between Mohanlal and Lal.The second half was little weak in comparison with the first,but made up to a large extent by the brilliantly presented climax fight sequence.Peter Hein deserves a special mention for those spine-tingling action sequences which for itself makes up for a delightful watch from the big screens.The VFX team did their part notably well,adding to the brilliance of the action choreography.The action sequences were top-notch and undoubtedly the best to comeout from mollywood till date.The initial and climax fights were the best part of the presentation and received huge applause from the crowd.On the negative side,the storyline was pretty predictable particularly to the second half that follows the normal pattern of masala entertainers that we have seen many a times before.The sub-plot involving Namitha,continuous praise of the protagonist by people around and a few double intenders could have been avoided to gain more pace and appeal among the family audience.The backgroundscore by Gopi Sunder was thrilling and boosted the appeal of the title character.Songs were average with the pick being the lullaby sung by Vani Jayaram.Shaji Kumar did a brilliant job behind the camera,elevating the impact of few trivial seqeunces on the silverscreen.Editing by John Kutty was fine.Coming to the performances Mohanlal was the backbone of the storyline and played the role of Murugan convincingly winning the hearts particularly in the emotional and action sequences.Another pic among the cast was the child artist who played the childhood part of Murugan brilliantly.Lal excelled with his amazing comic-timing.SurajVenjaramood,Vinu Mohan etc were good.Kamalini Mukherjee was okayish.Namitha didnt have much to perform than being the usual eye-candy as in her previous films.Jagapathy Babu was apt for portraying the role of the antagonist and portrayed his character effectively.Overall,Pulimurugan is a wholesome entertainer with some stunning stunts as the major highlight.",

Yeah, the story is only so-so but the characters keep your attention - both good and bad guys, and it is deceptively involving.The   good guys   in here are burlap-looking sewn puppets. Why they are who they are is explained near the end of the movie. The   bad guys   are the machines. Yes, this is familiar   Terminator   country, theme-wise, but the machines in this movie are brutal and scary. This movie is definitely not for little kids!If you keep your expectations in the   fair   range, and watch it on Blu-Ray, you should enjoy it. As mentioned, the story draws you in. On the other hand, if you are looking for something fantastic, you might be disappointed.",

Matthew doesnt know how to take the news or how to treat Danielle, and things go from bad to worse when Danielles former producer Kelly appears to take her back. ‚ÄîFilmFanUKTHE GIRL NEXT DOOR, Luke Greenfields sexy yet sweet teen angst flick, owes a lot to both the RISKY BUSINESS premise (HS Senior, his goal a prestigious college, has his life turned upside-down by world-wise Pro), and the internal structure of John Hughes 80s teen classics (geeky hero, and his two geekier friends, gain acceptance and prestige through his relationship with a dream girl).Close your eyes, and you could easily picture the young Anthony Michael Hall or John Cusack filling Emile Hirschs role, with Rebecca De Mornay or Kelly Preston replacing Elisha Cuthbert as his ex-porn star girlfriend. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, however, actually works quite well, thanks to Greenfields tongue-in-cheek approach to the naughtiness, and a flawless supporting cast, particularly Timothy Olyphant as a likable but ultimately ruthless porn producer, and Timothy Bottoms and Donna Bullock, as Hirschs clueless but blindly supportive parents. Emile Hirsch shows a propensity towards soulfully earnest expressions, but does provide one of the films funniest scenes, as, while high on Ecstasy, he attempts to navigate through a crowd awaiting his speech on high moral fiber. While some critics tended to brush off Elisha Cuthberts performance as just another skin-baring boy toy variation, she actually conveys the vulnerability and pain of her characters past quite effectively, balancing it with sly humor and a LOT of sex appeal, done within the restraints of her No Nudity contract clause...Sorry, guys, while youll see a LOT of her skin, you ARENT going to see Elisha bare all...The film is a very funny, breezy lark, and while it never achieves the heights of insanity of RISKY BUSINESS, it certainly stands as one of the better teen comedies of the past few years!",

There is so much attention to detail, that you are left gazing at the screen in awe. The 2 hours races by, and afterwards you are left with the satisfaction of having just seen something quite unique and surreal.Its a kids film of course, so there is little need to point out the predictable story elements - which exist in Cars more so than previous Pixar films such as The Incredibles. Cars is less daring, is safer in its approach. There are no surprising or wild deviations on the fairly straight road the story follows. But nevertheless, its all very cool stuff, and the story is entertaining enough. Cars is a must see Pixar film - even if the visuals steal the show.",

The first   Cars   film, was a great movie, not a perfect film. It was one of the least better films, Pixar has made, but thats like saying, Insomnia was one of Christopher Nolans worst films. I had high expectations when coming to see the film, like I always have before I see a Pixar film.After my viewing of the film, I have to say Pixar never fails to produce a great, entertaining film. Although it doesnt reach the heights of Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc. It still stands by itself pretty high up there. The animation is extremely well done, the look of the film is amazing. The voice actors are great, I miss Paul Newman though. Although the film is not perfect. The movie is not perfect though, the story is not great, but not bad, the movie does not have the emotional as other Pixar films, but it is definitely not a heartless film. But the film is definitely entertaining and a great beginning to 2011 Summer movie season. Take your whole family to see this movie, it will probably not disappoint. It will not only satisfy kids, but also the adults, this film is for everyone. Fun for kids, but the adults can also connect with it and will have a great time watching this movie in theaters.

The whole production builds up around Lightning McQueen, rightly, before strangely having a conclusion that focuses on newbie Cruz Ramirez. I like the idea of what they were going for, but the way the do it is actually quite poor - it feels too forced, as well as chucking most of the development for McQueen across acts one and two out the window.With that said, it isnt a massive hindrance. I still had a fun time with this. Owen Wilson remains good as McQueen, while Cristela Alonzo gives an accomplished performance as Ramirez. One thing I do rate about Alonzo is that Disney didnt go down the obvious, lovey-dovey route with her.None of the rest of the cast standout all that much, though its cool to hear Kerry Washington as Natalie Certain. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is arguably underused, which is weird as he is overused in the 2011 sequel - they dont seem to know how to fit him in ideally.The overall premise itself is interesting, while the animation remains in top gear. The ending doesnt fit perfectly for me, but I can still recommend that you give this a viewing.",

    "story": "Former CIA spy Bob Ho takes on his toughest assignment to date: looking after his girlfriends three kids (who havent exactly warmed to their moms beau). When one of the youngsters accidentally downloads a top-secret formula, Bobs longtime nemesis, a Russian terrorist, pays a visit to the family. ‚ÄîAnonymousThere is something strange and irrational about the human psyche that draws us to films that we know are absurd and bad, but in spite of the glaring flaws of such films we get drawn in anyway because the experience is pleasurable. One of those films is The Spy Next Door. It was obvious to me that The Spy Next Door had almost nothing to offer its audience in terms of a plot or even characters that could transcend their stereotypes. These stereotypes include (1) All Russians are evil; (2) the female love interest always finds an implausible reason for dumping Bob Ho (Jackie Chan)before she later reconciles with him; (3) If you want to gain the respect of bullies, you have to beat someone up - preferably an evil Russian who is storming throughout your house looking for a secret formula; (4) If you have Jackie Chan in your film, give him lots of choreographed karate or agile tricks to do; and (5) If you want to win over kids who are not your own, you better be a great action hero. I also realized that this film was trying to get by on Jackie Chans personality and the characters of the kids.Yet I did not care because up to a point reliance on the Jackie Chan persona, which this film was clearly doing, actually worked. The reason is that Jackie Chan is a good natured guy, very modest and very nice. It is to an extent amusing watching Chan perform his tricks as he copes with babysitting and then takes on the bad guys. The action scenes were, in my mind, not like the ordinary, overly violent action scenes where the good guy shoots up a bunch of bad guys. They are dance routines, some of them plain silly and others that are pretty good - and you get the impression that even if you are a bad guy you are unlikely to get badly hurt. Jackie Chan himself has often said that he abhors violence and his Bob Ho character is not a violent man. He gets involved in action scenes reluctantly and, even as he wins his little battles, one gets the impression that they were all a lot of fun. Now this is not to say that I can guarantee that you, my readers, are going to like this film. You may dislike it for many sound reasons, but for me The Spy Next Door is one of my guilty favorites.",

The characters in this look like members of Team Galaxy. Its just something with those green haircuts.It was pretty cool to see Nobita and Doraemon use their light weight to fight the villains. Well, they did have these guns, so I guess thats kind of like a cowboy, right? Im proud to be the first person to review these films. Im just that much into other cultures. I saw two of these films pretty close together. I guess the animation doesnt look that impressive anymore with its improvements but its still very nice. It is kind of weird how it tries to be more serious, especially near the end. Its still good. ***",

    "story": "Doraemon, Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo set out on an adventure in the Caribbean Sea. Nobita is the captain of a ship and fights his enemies on board. Shizuka gets kidnapped, and a storm impedes their journey. Mini-Dora help Nobita and friends on their journey. When the adventurers finally find the mysterious Treasure Island, they discover it is more than just an ordinary island. ‚ÄîKhush SidhuNo other animated character can claim to have had one big-screen feature each year for the past 12 years, but that alone is testament to the popularity of the time-travelling blue robot cat (not raccoon dog, mind you, which happens to be one of the running jokes in this movie). This 38th feature instalment in the Doraemon anime franchise sees the titular character and his boy companion Nobita embark on a seafaring journey to explore a mysterious island that has suddenly appeared off the southern coast of Japan, although when they eventually reach the volcanic land mass, they discover that there is more, much more, to the island than meets the eye.As penned by novelist Genki Kawamura (who produced some of the most successful Japanese feature animations in recent memory, like Your Name, Fireworks and The Boy and the Beast), the story deliberately draws from some of the more memorable references of Robert Louis Stevensons classic Treasure Island novel, so those who remember the book will certainly recall the pirate named John Silver, his talking parrot and the boy whom Silver is fond of. In any case, the opening minutes of the movie give a quick rundown of these references, just before Nobita wakes up from his daydream and muses how hed like to go on a real-life modern-day pirate adventure.Nobitas wish - and perhaps to an equal extent, his pestering - become Doraemons command, who pulls out a magical Treasure Hunter map to look for a yet-unexplored treasure island, as well as a miniature sailboat DIY kit and a magnifying glass to construct the square-rigged ship that they will use to reach the island. Nobita uses the Anywhere Door to ask his best friend and love interest Shizuka along, while the quick-tempered bully Gian and fox-faced rich kid Suneo invite themselves along the way. The quintet are also joined by the Mini-Doras, who prove resourceful as ever when the rest get into tight spots, so if youre keeping score, only Doraemons younger sister Dorami sits out this one. Without giving too much away, lets just say that Shizuka is kidnapped during their initial encounter with Flint and his band of pirates, owing to a striking resemblance she has with Flints younger daughter Sarah. At the same time, Nobita will pick up Flints elder son Flock, who reveals not only that he has run away from his father but also that Flint has some nefarious plan up his sleeve that will threaten the very fate and future of Planet Earth. Its not a literal adaptation of the book of course, but youll appreciate the generous creative liberties that Kawamura and director Kazauki Imai have taken with the source material, even turning Flints parrot into a chaperone robot named Quiz who likes to greet anyone and everyone he meets with riddles.Make no mistake, this isnt just a feature-length version of the Saturday morning cartoons youd probably acquaint the Doraemon character with; rather, Imais film is really a rollicking adventure fit for the whole family (except of course for the fact that youll have to be old enough to be able to read the subtitles to understand the dialogue). There is a genuine childlike sense of wonder and thrill every step of the way, thanks to Kawamuras inventive plotting as well as Imais rich and vivid visual imagination. There are loads of humour and witticisms, courtesy of Doraemons boundless gadgets and Quizs verbal puzzles. And last but not least, there is even surprising poignance at the end of it, as Silvers ostensible selfish motivations are revealed to be no more than misguided obsessions about completing his beloved late wifes legacy.It is no coincidence that Nobitas Treasure Island has since gone and become the highest grossing instalment in Doraemon history, seeing as how there is plenty here to entertain those among us who are growing up and those among us who had grown up with the lovable robot cat. In particular, the latter will probably find the conclusion unexpectedly moving just as we did, and in fact come to sympathise with how Silver just wanted to do right for the sake of his children and their future. Like we said at the start, no other animated franchise has been as prolific or enduring, and this latest film is itself reason why Doraemon is so beloved and will likely continue to be for generations to come. There is treasure indeed in this fascinating time-travelling tale of discovery, friendship and reconciliation, so embrace your inner child and hop on for the adventure!",

That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.I didnt read the book, so I dont know the story, witch might have suffered, as stories usually do from books to picture, but I think a writer couldnt hope for a better image, better portraits of characters, especially the black dragon who one definitely falls in love with - the mimic and the gestures and the face expressions, so complex and real. I agree its not the kind of movie that makes you keep thinking too much once its finished bot its not meant to be. Its just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and Im 22). The film wasnt too long, it didnt have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all.I dont know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again. Great special effects and, again, a very lovely dragon.",

    "story": "Seven-year-old Tim Templeton has always had an overactive imagination--and for the past seven years--life has been all peaches and cream, getting all the love and affection from his caring parents. However, after the arrival of Boss Baby, an unexpected new brother dressed in a black suit complete with a tie and a briefcase, little by little, Tim realises that the cute newcomer has taken over the whole house, robbing him of his happiness. But, soon, Tim and the new boss in a diaper will need to put differences aside and join forces, as a sneaky scheme involving the head of Puppy Co. threatens to tilt the balance of power towards their insidiously adorable furry antagonists. Now, the next pet convention is only in two days. So, brothers, hurry up. ‚ÄîNick RiganasHes cute! He has got a big head! And he is in theaters this weekend. He is the Boss Baby and his movie is the focus of this review. Hi fans, Robbie K is back again with another review, and this time on the latest animation movie to hit the silver screen. What does this animated feature film have in store? Im happy to share some thoughts on the subject, so why dont we get started shall we? LIKES: ¬ï Good animation ¬ï Cute ¬ï Unique Twist on a story ¬ï Incredibly Fun ¬ï Funny and Clever ¬ï Movie ReferencesSummary: As you saw in the trailers, Boss Baby is another example of how incredible our animation technology is and this time it is wrapped up in a cute as a button package. This film may be one of the most adorable animation pieces to hit this year, and many will fall in love with the whimsical charm of this film. Now that we have the obvious wrapped up let us get to the real gold of this film. Its difficult to find a unique twist on a story, but the risk taken with Boss Babys story was well executed. The tale has many layers to it involving adapting to new family members, pursuit of your dreams, and of course what is better babies or puppies. With surprising detail and character development, the story is very entertaining and fun as baby and brother try to stop the dastardly puppies from taking over. And the best part is¬Ö the whole adventure is fun and fast paced, with seldom a boredom moment in this fast-moving flick. Lets hit the comedy now. Boss Baby again excels in this aspect providing a variable mix of comedic styles to entertain all ages. Young (and young at heart) will enjoy the simplistic comedy that involves the characters dropping mindless (meme-worthy) one liners, various screams of fear, and dopey run-ins with a wall. The real comedic diamonds though are the cleverer puns, one-liners, and adult references hidden in this movie. Alec Baldwins sarcastic delivery and edginess worked for me, adding just the right touches to maximize the laughs. Yet, Im a sucker for all the movie references integrated into this plot and how key they were to the adventure. And if you are nerd like me, you may get an extra thrill keeping your eye out for the next reference. DISLIKES: ¬ï Predictable ¬ï A bit of a stretch ¬ï A little preachy at times ¬ï More Babycorp use ¬ï Better EditingSummary: Despite how much I enjoyed the story, much of it is still predictable. Boss Baby has some surprising twists, but no manner of fun, can hide the blatantly obvious ending that is to come. While predictability is difficult to avoid, Boss Baby could have tidied things up a bit to give the finale a little more flare. In addition, they could have worked hard to not be so preachy near the end about the importance of family and all that lovey-dovey mush that animation films do all the time. Lets talk about some developmental issues I had with the movies. First off, the movie has moments that are a bit of a stretch. Yes, I know this movie is ridiculous and a stretch to begin with, but hear me out. Boss Babys adult cast are a bit idiotic at best, somehow not hovering over the newborns to hear them speaking. If that wasnt enough, some of the more dangerous stunts involved were also not as   noticeable  , which after some point should have been discovered. Although fun, this ridiculousness didnt fit so much into the grand scheme of the plot. Next up is Babycorp, the organization the boss baby works for. This large plot point has dramatic build up and gets a large sequence to explain the wonders of this magnificent corporation. Yet after that, the film fails to deliver more on the potential plot points that could have come with it. Had the trailers not built up the baby vs. puppy rivalry as they did, I could have let this go, but with all the advertising I would have liked to see more of this. Finally, the editing of the movie. Boss Baby has a lot of great parts that foster imagination, love, and all those positive qualities we love in an animated movie. However, much of these moments were not necessary, often just extending the run time under the guise of character development. While I dont think they needed to eliminate these parts (after all it is only 90 minutes), they certainly could have altered these scenes to be a little more relevant to the adventure. The VERDICT:Despite all the lower scores, Boss Baby was an entertaining spectacle that is fun, funny, and clever at many points. This movie is certainly adorable and is the perfect family film (for all ages) to hit the screen this year. Yes, it is simplistic and silly, and doesnt have as much magic as a Disney film, but its nice to have unique, story that doesnt involve making a political ordeal out of it. This reviewer recommends this one for the theater for group outings and those with kids, but definitely check this one out when it hits homes. My scores are: Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",

    "story": "Bruce is an ordinary Gamma expert who one day gets blasted with radiation and somehow survives. But in the process a monster was born. Now whenever he gets angry he grows bigger and stronger until he is no longer Bruce Banner. He becomes The HulkHulk is a very surprising film. When I first saw it when I was like nine or ten I was confused, shocked and somewhat disappointed. My expectations at the time had not been met. What I had been expecting and hoping was just endless scenes of the hulk smashing sh#t up. What I got was an art film. At the time I didnt understand or care about any of the split screens, dream sequences, etc, I was just waiting for the hulk to show up and destroy stuff.(The hulk dosent show up till about 40 minutes into the movie, by the way.) I eventually began to get restless because it is a very slow movie and when it was over I felt very disappointed.A few years later I bought the DVD to give it another try, and I was very surprised with how good it actually was, now that I had gotten older and could appreciate the style, acting and pretty much everything else. The acting is quite good in the film, especially Nick Nolte, who almost steals the show as Bruce Banners father, David Banner. Eric Bana is decent as the hulk, but I prefer Mark Ruffalo as the hulk in the avengers. Unlike other movies based on comic books, Hulk actually looks like a comic book, due to the split screens. This works most of the time,as it gives the film a unique look thats different from other comic book movies.Now to the much criticised CGI, which for me is a mixed bag. The close ups of the hulk work, because his facial expressions are well done and you can actually feel sympathy for him. However the long shots of him, especially in the desert scenes, look a bit cheesy but definitely not as bad as some critics have been saying. Apart from that the visual effects are top notch.Overall, Hulk is a refreshing change from standard and bland superhero movies. It takes its time setting up the plot and characters, which works because you have almost fully fleshed out characters and not cardboard cut outs. The repressed memories and psychology of the hulk is much more interesting than the standard heroics of superman or captain America. So to sum it up, I wouldnt recommend this movie to young kids because there are a number of intense scenes and it is a fairly long and slow movie, so those with short attention spans wont be well rewarded. But for those who are prepared to accept that it is more an art film than an action film then you will be well rewarded.The film isnt perfect, but every time I watch it on DVD it grows on me and I find myself wishing sometimes that more action blockbusters were like this, but then if they were I doubt they would be blockbusters.",

I could pick out individual hairs in the animals coats. I also liked that the artists paid attention to the animals mouths. They were not just mere flaps of skin covering teeth, but it looked like the mouth region actually had some depth, that the lips were also 3D along with the rest of the animal. The humans had a distinct look and style about them that made me think of 2D cartoons. Big and imposing, shady and dangerous, cute and cuddly, the artwork certainly helped draw a person in. Ambition- The Nut Job tried to draw on several genres of film. It attempts to reshape these stories and form into a family friendly movie. I could spot a crime drama, a voyage of self discovery, a tale of redemption and rejoining society, just to name a few. The film also provided some rudimentary information about the animal species through dialogue, so it did have some educational moments. Whether or not the film succeeded in its ambitions will be covered in the not-so-good section. The Not-So-Good: Pacing- What a colossal mess. The Nut Job is a short 86 minutes and the film tried to show at least three different story arcs. The audience is not shown how the characters will respond to any event because the next event is following hot on the heels of its predecessor. Because of this, any connection or concern for the characters is lost in the fray of action and fart jokes...yes, Ill get there too. Characters- Unfortunately the pacing of the film allows the survival of only the most basic character types. Might as well forget about character development too. And learning. And change for the better. Comedy- I had hoped that the family film genre had grown past this, I really did. Situational and character-based comedy has made significant headway into the family films. Granted it may be a little silly to laugh at Mr. Potato-Heads parts stuck in a flour tortilla, but I found it to be incredibly funny. Or how about when a mermaid becomes a human and, as a result of misguiding information told to her in a previous scene, she puts a fork and a pipe to hilarious use at the dinner table. Fart jokes. Maybe with the compressed story arcs, the only form of comic relief could come from this. The Nut Job tried to meld several different genres and in so doing, did not execute any of them well. Youve seen better representatives of the genres attempted here and Id suggest seeing them instead. 4/10",

Fans of all ages wont want to miss this heart-stopping adventure as tussling twosome Tom and Jerry join Jonny Quest and his pal Hadji and embark on a dangerous spy mission in order to save the world. Its just another day at the beach for the dueling Tom and Jerry ... until they bump into world-class junior spies Jonny Quest and Hadji and their canine companion, Bandit. When longtime Quest family nemesis Dr. Zin discovers that Jonnys father, Dr. Benton Quest, possesses a device that could solve the worlds energy problems, Zin sends his evil cat army to steal it and capture Benton and his bodyguard, Race Bannon. Thats when Jonny and his new furry friends spring into action! Get set for intrigue, thrills and suspense for the whole family. Tia Carrere and Tim Matheson lend their voices.Warner Bros have 3, maybe 4 lines of cartoon movies for the direct market. DC, Scooby Doo, Tom & Jerry and with the Flintstones vs WWE, maybe the Flintstones too. I have window shopping other T&J movies while waiting for this to arrive, and the cat and mouse team did Blast Off For Mars which is a similar title to Abbott and Costello Go To Mars. And like Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, in this movie we have a slapstick comedy team sliding effortlessly into an existing adventure franchise to bring a little comedy with out diminishing the adventure of the story. If you can like a pairing of Tom and Jerry with the Quest team, this movie does not disappoint. There are a few incredulous moments you have to go with, but as the action never lets up, they are super forgivable. And if you are a fan of Tom and Jerry, this movie has 3- 5 break-out scenes of cat and mouse tomfoolery. The movie opens with a Spike and Tyke cameo, and features visits from Droopy and Jezebel Jade. (Though disappointingly there is one animation of Droopy run twice the same way.) James Hong gives Doctor Zin a level of character never before seen, and will have you wondering if the voice isnt Ken Jeong. The character designs by Dan Haskett are wonderful in a very John K type of way, when Kricfalusi isnt trying to gross people out. This is giant piles of fun that never lets up. My hope is that this movie does so well that Jonny Quest will get more direct market movies and that, like the Mummy and Invisible man sequels to A&C Meet Frankenstein, Tom and Jerry might visit Space Ghost and The Herculoids. Thundarr The Barbarian would probably be a bridge too far, for a Tom and Jerry crossover. But if they made it, I would watch it.",

With the help of his tricked-out streetwise snail crew, this ultimate underdog puts his heart and shell on the line to prove that no dream is too big, and no dreamer too small. ‚ÄîDreamWorks Animation  Turbo   may not be the most original or inventive animated film ever but its a good time and pretty fun. The story is pretty simple and one that a little child can imagine. But the way it delivers the story is gorgeous. It has lovable characters and sense of humor. Theo (who prefers to be called Turbo) is a garden snail who lives as an outsider among his snail community. His dream of becoming the Indianapolis 500 champion makes him an outcast and his obsession with speed brings embarrassment to his brother, Chet. However, after an unexpected accident, Theo is granted incredible speed and also inherits some characteristics of an actual car (headlights, radio). He is then taken by a chubby guy named Tito. Tito and his brother Angelo own a taco shop that is struggling. The other tenants in the area are also facing the same problem. Tito has this idea of registering Turbo into the Indy 500 in order to help his business prosper. And there are also other snails who become Turbos buddies.   Turbo   may not have as much depth as some of the animated masterpieces. But   Turbo   doesnt aim in being that. It wants to become a fun-filled adventure about a freaking-fast snail racing in the midst of an array of monstrous cars. And it doesnt disappoint. Its enjoyable, slick and plenty of fun. The characters are likable too. Turbo is ambitious, funny, and adventurous. All the qualities of a fun character are embodied in him. Chet, his brother, is caring and more cautious but is also adorable in some moments. The other snails are also plenty of fun due to their ridiculous antics. Besides the mollusks, we also have the human characters. Tito, with his large build, is extremely chubby and funny. Titos other friends are also a joy to watch.   Turbo   also has a great sense of humor. I had a blast watching this film. Not all the jokes work, but most of them do. But I do want to mention that theres a joke concerning crows snatching one snail at a time, and to me it seems a bit extreme because the idea of a snail being eaten by a crow is kinda creepy, dont you think? Or maybe its just me. But the bottom line is   Turbo   is plenty of fun to watch. The animation is not the best Ive seen but its pretty good. It possesses beautiful sets and the colors are fluorescent. The voice cast was excellent too and Ryan Reynolds did a great job lending his voice to Turbo.   Turbo   is a fun and rollicking adventure and it is plenty of joy to watch these lovable characters see what theyre up to. Just dont expect too much from it and dont expect it to be a masterpiece. Rating: 7/10Final Verdict: It may not be original but   Turbo   is a hell of a roller-coaster ride that will provide plenty of joy and laughs with its lovable characters.",

This is a really fine film. It takes on issues of prejudice and cultural diversity. Zootopia is a city where animals live side by side, predator and prey. It is not a utopia because law and order is necessary. A little female rabbit messes with the male dominated police force.

Basus movies are the victims of this, Basus movies are not so easy to understand, his films hide some messages that you understand after thinking a lot. That is why his films flopped because Indian viewers want item numbers as well as Oscars. Second reason, Most of the Indian viewers love naked actresses dancing, liquor, cars, unrealistic cliche stories, some unrealistic happy ideal families with full of values, mockery of eunuchs on the big screen but if someone says anything about superstition (which pk, omg showed) about God, then they have problems. The movie did not say that God doesnt exist. He said that your actions will decide the end of your life. We dont know whether there is hell and heaven or not, but we should always do our deeds, leave the consequences to God. The movie said that God is there, but dont do business in his name because your actions are the ultimate judge, wholl decide if youre made for heaven or hell.One star less because some scenes were confusing.",

Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning. ‚ÄîAnthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com>Its really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,its also a tremendous achievement for its director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say   Im king of the world   when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.The modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Camerons real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kates Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.However,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,its schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.Titanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horners best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Roses fianc√©e,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}Overall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this.",

    "story": "Ray Breslin is a man who has devoted his life to making prisons inescapable by going into a prison as an inmate and trying to see if he can break out. And he has done a good job so far. A woman who says she works for the CIA approaches Ray and says that a new maximum security prison where the worst criminals are to be incarcerated, is about to be launched. So she wants him to go and make sure no one can get out. He agrees. So they make the necessary preps but when Ray arrives at the prison, he discovers that someone doesnt want him to get out. He then tries to find a way out but he needs help. Another prisoner, Rottmeyer becomes friendly with him. And they decide to work together to get out. ‚Äîrcs0411@yahoo.comHaving grown up with the action movies of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, to name but a few, during my childhood and youth, then it is always refreshing to see these iconic action stars on the screen.Initially, I had some reservations about   Escape Plan  , especially since this is the third prison movie of Stallones, and the synopsis for this movie didnt really promise something great.But I am glad that I saw it, because   Escape Plan   delivered the goods. This is a great action/thriller in every sense, and if you grew up with Stallone and Schwarzeneggers movies, then you definitely do not want to miss out on this one.The storyline, shortly summarized, is about Ray Breslin (played by Stallone) who goes undercover in secure prison facilities in order to test their security measures and prove that they are indeed not inescapable. Taking on a new job, Breslin finds himself in over his head in a very strange facility, where he has to team up with Rottmayer (played by Schwarzenegger) if he is to break free of captivity.The action sequences are great, as they always are with these guys. But what also made the movie so great, was the plot line and the revealing of what was really going on with the prison facility. That was a twist of events that I found really good.There are some great names to the cast list, aside from Stallone and Schwarzenegger, such as Sam Neill, Vinnie Jones and Vincent DOnofrio. Personally I cant claim to find any enjoyment in hip hop star 50 cents as an actor, and he is not one I would put my money on. But luckily his role is a minor one.  Escape Plan   is definitely a mans movie, full of action, testosterone (although not up to par with   Expendables), and an interesting and well executed storyline. The movie is definitely well worth a watch if you enjoy action and thrillers.",

Its not a Feel Good movie you should take a date on in the hopes of coming away high on life and hand in hand. Its a movie thatll make you think and might disturb the uninformed viewer who knows little about the politics of war.This is a movie based on actual events (that means its a movie that has some truth to it). From what I heard the director made quite a bit of research of the gun running world when creating this movie.This movie takes a look at the gun running business through the story of one particular trafficker played by Cage. It goes through two decades of wars & conflicts and how the business and politics of gun running works. Cage is the middle man in that world, who navigates through it very professionally and coolly. Cages character is made to be likable, but not a hero by any means.Many people may think that this movie depicts certain cultures and races in a bad light, but if you know anything about history and keep up to date with world events youll understand the truth behind these portrayals.The movie is interesting because it is as close as to a realistic look to arms trafficking as Hollywood could produce without making a documentary. Its refreshing because of this.I hope people see this movie because it very much shows the truth behind how wars are supplied and how the richest nations in the world have done this for the ultimate prize¬Ö that thing that makes the world go round ¬ñ Money.The movie as a whole is produced very well and the acting and cinematography is up to par with the type of film it is (as mentioned before, dont expect a big production Hollywood action flick).Dont expect your typical Hollywood ending here either.(Id compare this movie with Buffalo Soldiers (2001) with Joaquin Phoenix)",

Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming. ‚ÄîWarner Bros. PicturesWhat is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywoods most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though hes increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: InceptionThen what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobbs brainiac specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a   forger   who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You dont just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the Best Director category. If   Inception   is a metaphysical puzzle, its also a metaphorical one: Its hard not to draw connections between Cobbs dream-weaving and Nolans film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards",

With a new boy arriving every thirty days, the group has been in   The Glade   for three years, trying to find a way to escape through the Maze that surrounds their living space (patrolled by cyborg monsters named Grievers).

For comparison, Fantastic Four had a budget of 120 million and the effects and so called set pieces were awful. This is one of the biggest problems with Hollywood, but thats a discussion for another day. The Maze Runner is actually a surprisingly entertaining movie. For an age in which the medium is flooded with young adult novels and movies, the film feels fresh and isnt overwhelmed by clich√©s like so many others are.Its led by a relatively unknown cast. Dylan OBrien, from Teen Wolf fame, is thrown into a maze structure along with a few dozen other young men who soon find there is more to the maze than they were led to believe. Let me be the first to say I think OBrien has some chops and definitely has a future in this business. The role doesnt require a ton of range, but I think he proved he can lead a huge action film, and not many actors can say that. The writing itself I thought could have been a little smarter and more mature. Will Poulter, who played a much different character in Were The Millers, was solid in the role that was given to him. But the writing had him doing some really stupid things and was full of forced dialogue I felt.With that being said, the mythology behind the story is pretty interesting. And they made the film into a more traditional monster film than Im sure the book originally called for, but it really works. The horror element to the film was by far the most intriguing, and had the biggest payoff. The Greavers also proved to be pretty terrifying, something I didnt think I would say about a film with a bunch of teenagers. So I really only watched this because Im probably going to see the sequel this weekend, and i ended up enjoying the movie. Plus, having Littlefinger as the next villain gets me pretty excited.+Monster flick+Surprisingly well acted+Suspensful-Some stupid dialogue7.2/10",

Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as Baby Binks parents; especially the three enterprising kidnappers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. Successfully kidnapping Baby Bink, they have a harder time keeping hold of the rascal, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than the three bumbling criminals. ‚ÄîMurray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>Despite being the heir to a small fortune Baby Bink has never had his picture in the paper like other rich babies.  However his mother hires a famous photographer to take his picture.  However when the photographers arrive they are actually kidnappers who steal away baby Bink and demand a ransom.  However Baby Bink manages to slip out of their sight and begins a journey through the city of his story book.  The kidnappers try to catch him but seem to be always one step behind.John Hughes wont be remembered in the same way as ¬ëgreat filmmakers will be - but like it or not, he knows how to do this type of film with his eyes closed.  This never gets above the same cartoon humour of Home Alone, but it still manages to be very funny.  The story is daft - the baby going through the city by recognising things from his story book, however the cartoon humour is very good throughout.  Some scenes (with the worried mother) and the ending cant help but lapse into sentiment, but for the most part its sheer comedy antics.The reason the comedy works is not due to the baby - he is cute but he never dominates the way Mulcaly Culkin did, instead he haplessly crawls his way around using `baby luck.  What makes it work are three really funny performances from the kidnappers.  One of my favourite actors Joe Mantegna is usually above this type of stuff, but hes really funny here.  Similarly Joe Pantoliano has been in his share of blockbusters and is funny here with Haley.  The support cast has its fair share of famous faces - Boyle is lumbered with all the emotional scenes and Matthew Glave (The Wedding Singer) doesnt have much to do.  An uncredited Mike Starr as an informant, Fred Dalton Thompson as the cop, Cynthia Nixon (Sex and the City) as the nanny and Anna Levine (Bad Boys, Unforgiven, The Crow) as an understanding mother make interesting appearances.  However when the kidnappers are off the screen things arent as good and start to drag.Overall you know what to expect from this.  If youre in the mood for Tom & Jerry style cartoon humour (as opposed to Jerry & Tom humour - Mantegna fans will understand!) then this is a really good laugh.  Simple, unmemorable but fun!",

    "story": "Luck hasnt always been in favour of Arjun, a gifted cricketer in his mid-thirties whose career has failed to take off. With everyone around him insisting that he should give up on his career, will Arjun have the courage of conviction to continue pursuing his dream?One of the best movie in recent times. Director Gautam Tinnanuri has delivered an excellent film and has used his abilities perfectly for his second film too. The screen play for this movie also looks similar as his first movie Malli Raava. Subtle performances by the cast Nani and Shraddha Srinath. Supporting cast Sathya Raj, Praveen etc. have also played their role with so much of life. The emotions between the Father and Son Relation is brought up amazingly. The climax is the Heart of the film. Music Director Anirudh Ravichander has given his one of the best ever songs and beautiful Background Score. Magical Scenes in some important and emotional places. The subtitle of this film   It is never too late to dream.!   is brought up beautifully in the climax. The only drawback I feel as a movie freak is the lack of concentration on the cricketing scenes and quite the story becomes a bit predictable. But totally a package of love, emotion, passion, journey. Must Watch Film for everyone. Thanks, Vijay Kashyap",

    "story": "Bound by an inescapable blood debt to the Italian crime lord, Santino DAntonio, and with his precious 1969 Mustang still stolen, John Wick--the taciturn and pitiless assassin who thirsts for seclusion--is forced to visit Italy to honour his promise. But, soon, the Bogeyman will find himself dragged into an impossible task in the heart of Romes secret criminal society, as every killer in the business dreams of cornering the legendary Wick who now has an enormous price on his head. Drenched in blood and mercilessly hunted down, John Wick can surely forget a peaceful retirement as no one can make it out in one piece. ‚ÄîNick Riganas  John Wick: Chapter 2   (2017 release; 122 min.) continues the adventures of former (?) hit man John Wick. As the movie opens, we are immediately thrown in the middle of a car vs. bike chase, and next thing we know, we find our man retrieving his beloved Mustang from a chop shop in NYC, but not without cars flying about, and dozens of dead or wounded bodies. And thats all in the pre-opening credits! As the story unfolds, Wick, who wants   out, is nevertheless forced back   in   when an Italian baddie calls in a favor and Wick has no choice but to accept. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: director (and former stunt man) Chad Stahelski returns at the helm following the surprise success of the first John Wick movie, and once again delivers a highly stylish and ultra- violent action movie. When you watch the opening car chases (yes, in plural), its like watching a synchronized ballet performance. I would not go as far to say that the story line doesnt matter, it does to a degree, but lets be honest: the reason we are there is to watch the car chases and the shoot-outs and the almost cartoonish level of violence that is so over the top, you cant help but laugh at it. Stahelskis thinking must have been:   when in doubt, (i) throw more bodies at it, and (ii) keep the focus on Keanu Reeves  . Reeves is cold as ice in the best possible way, and it suits him perfectly in the film. Laurence Fishburn plays a small role (as another baddie) and the scenes where Reeves and Fishburn appear together are their first joint scenes ever since the Matrix Trilogy, if you can believe it. I couldnt believe how quickly these 2 hours flew by and Im not spoiling anything when I tell you that the movies ending sets it up nicely for a Chapter 3 in a couple of years. Count me in!The movie opened wide this past weekend, and the Sunday matin√©e screening where I saw this at was absolutely jam-packed, somewhat to my surprise. Did I mention this movie is ultra-violent? And that its rated R for good reason? I was outright dismayed to see how many small kids were in the theater. In the very row in front of me, there was a couple with three small girls, Im guessing ages 5 to 7. What are these people thinking?!? Meanwhile, for us grown-ups, if you liked the first John Wick, you are more than going to like this sequel, you are going to LOVE it, be it at the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu- ray.   John Wick: Chapter 2   is a WINNER.",

    "story": "A school-teacher in India sires a son named Gurukant, but is disappointed as the child fails to live up to his high expectations. When Gurukant grows up, he is unable to secure decent employment in India, so finds a way to go to Turkey, where he finds employment. When he returns back to India, he wants to start his own business, but is unable to do so, as he does not have enough money. So he does some research, gets to meet Sujata, the daughter of a wealthy man named Jignesh, and marries her. After the marriage, Gurukant finds out that Sujata has a dark past, but he ignores this - for his one motive is to be to rise in the eyes of his father - and get rich. ‚ÄîCarrieThis movie celebrates Abhishek Bachachan, his fathers son. When you are the son of one of the best actors of the world of all times, you have the pressure to step into the shoes of your father. It doesnt happen often that a son matches up to his father in stature.In this film Abhishek Bahcachan does just that. He gives a performance his old man wouldve been proud of. Abhishek proves his pedigree. This is a difficult role. Not only because he has to portray a wide range in his character but also because his character has some of the cheesiest lines. But he makes you forget that the lines are out of place here and there. He goes flat out on this one, and gives a performance which is probably the best of this year. Probably matching up to Amitabhs in Black.About the film. Its a Mani Ratnam film, which raises the expectations immensely and nearly lives up to it. Its a well written story and direction is up to the mark. There is a slight problem with screenplay and the songs and dance sequences break the flow of story telling. A good film nonetheless and a great viewing.Though Abhishek steals the show; other actors are pretty good too. Mithun proves again why he is 2 times National Award winner. He is a legendary actor who has been wasting his time and talent in crappy movies for a long time now. Hope he would get better roles after this. Ash is good in the second half but her choreography is not up to the mark and she looks bland and unsophisticated while dancing. Vidya Balan is wasted and R Madhvan is good in a small role.A word about cinematography is necessary. This is one of the best shot movies of last year, with breathtaking views and the last scene with Guru giving his speech to a stadium full of people looks more real than reality itself.Over all a good movie, best since Munna Bhai 2.",

Now i have promised myself never to waste my hard earned money on Bollywood movies before reading reviews from GOOD, fair and unbiased critics. Dabangg 2 literally have nothing in it . At least dabangg 1 had some originality, some funny jokes and scenes and most importantly it had something new but dabangg 2 is nothing but a bad copy of D1. First of all, a   free-fund   advice to arbas khan, please dont direct a movie again . The reason dabangg 1 was a bit better was because of its director unlike now . So here is how i am going to rate this movie ;Direction = 2 story( was there a story ?) = 2 music = 6 acting = 5",
